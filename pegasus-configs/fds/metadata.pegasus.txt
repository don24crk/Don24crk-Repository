  developed and released in 1987 by Konami. Much of the game's popularity came
  from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam
  dunks.Players can choose from one of four teams: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles
  and New York. There is no difference in skill level or abilities between the
  teams. Since there is no NBA license, no team names or player names are used,
  however, the teams wear the same color of their NBA counterparts (Boston wears
  green, Chicago red, etc.).

description:
  Humanity has colonized most planets in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and they now
  look towards expanding their reach by using an experimental travel technology
  called "Hyperzone Drive". However, a race of aliens who have already mastered
  that technology are currently invading planets at a quick pace, closing in on
  our solar system. The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it
  with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to
  defend itself.
  .
  The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space
  Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships
  that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens. However, the new
  technology proves hard to control, and only one of the ships manages to survive
  the trip: Falsion.

  erobern können. Wenn das nicht dein letztes "Leben" war, kannst du versuchen,
  dieses Alien abzuschießen und dein Schiff zurückzuerobern, sodaß du zwei Schiffe
  gleichzeitig hast und deine Feuerkraft verdoppelst.

  Anzahl der abgefeuerten Raketen, die zerstörten Feinde und den Prozentsatz der
  getroffenen Ziele.

game: Golf : Japan Course
file: ./Golf - Japan Course (Japan).zip
developer: HAL Laboratory
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Sport-Sport / Golf
description:
  An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots
  Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses
  modeled after real courses in Japan.
  .
  Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play.
  Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by
  getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just
  involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each
  hole in as few strokes as possible.
  .
  When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust
  the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the
  direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a
  meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball
  is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so
  they can get into a rhythm using this meter.
  .
  This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their
  personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a
  Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the
  player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a
  contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden
  colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game
  contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of
  this game.

  It’s the middle of the 21st century. The armies of Lord Halley are launching

  specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through
  their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to
  commence!
  .
  Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in
  locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end
  of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There
  are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular
  asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add
  explosive pods and shields.
  .
  Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your
  journey. Each comet and ship that you don’t shoot makes it to earth and does
  some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths
  damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1%
  of Earths damage is repaired.

game: Ice Hockey

developer: Nintendo
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Sport-Sport / Eishockey
description:
  The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in
  real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey
  stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of
  five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players
  wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made
  up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points
  at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team
  face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first
  is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in
  all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very
  powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly
  designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a
  goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including
  the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone
  which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and
  others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing
  players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into
  the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put
  in the penalty box for a period of time.

description:
  Knight Lore is a a 3D isometric adventure game by Jaleco, originally released by
  the British game company Ultimate. Saberman, the hero of the game, has been
  cursed by an evil wizard. Every night, he turns into a creepy werewolf and he is
  on a journey to retrieve all the necessary ingredients to create a magic potion.
  This potion, he hopes, will get him to return to his human shape. The game
  starts in a dark forest, somewhere in there the wizard awaits for the potion's
  ingredients such as diamonds, bottles etc... Our hero's task is to wander around
  and find them, one at the time, and bring them back to him. But our hero must
  watch out, he turns into a werewolf at night and the wizard won't hesitate to
  use his magic against him. Saberman must make sure to always approach him as a
  human. Up to three items can be carried at the same time, they can also be
  dropped on the ground and climbed to reach higher platforms. However, once a new
  ingredient is delivered to the wizard, our hero leaves empty handed and lose all
  stored items. Series of enemies and hazards are of course scattered along his
  path, such as spirits, spikes or pits. Once all the ingredients are collected,
  the game jumps to another location where more objects need to be found with
  meaner hazards and enemies. This is also the point where the player's progress
  can be saved.

game: Nazo no Kabe : Block Kuzushi

developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
description:
  In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the
  Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a
  planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.
  .
  But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some
  kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and
  get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure,
  starts its countdown.
  .
  There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit
  code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors
  in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid
  self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an
  energy ball.
  .
  Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's
  probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but
  also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart
  from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a
  bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips,
  skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your
  ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the
  cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into
  the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the
  ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who
  will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.

genre: Sport-Sport / Tischtennis
description:
  Smash Ping Pong simulates the game of ping-pong or table tennis in a remarkably
  different manner than prior simulations of any variety of tennis. Rather than
  putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to
  return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's
  speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of
  themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically
  move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need
  only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of
  swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the
  choice of forehand or backhand.
  .
  The Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published
  directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot
  Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title
  screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The
  conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games,
  plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty. Additionally, Deuce win
  conditions do not end at 15 points, but can climb as high as 99 points.

  Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic  (translated as "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding
  Panic") is a Japan-only video game developed by Nintendo in cooperation with
  Fuji Television for the Family Computer Disk System to promote its event called
  Yume Koujou '87 (translates to Dream Factory '87).
  .
  It was later released outside of Japan in an altered format under the name Super
  Mario Bros. 2, since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. sequel, Super Mario
  Bros.: The Lost Levels, was deemed too similar to the original and too difficult
  for overseas players. Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic
  was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA.
  .
  The story starts with two chidren, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully
  reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the
  book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu
  suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky
  dream world.
  .
  The goal of Doki Doki Panic is to help the whole family (namely Imajin, Lina and
  their parents Mama and Papa) rescue their poor children kidnaped by the evil
  king lizard. Each member has its own strengths and weaknesses - Imaji is a
  balanced character whereas Lina is fairly light weight and can effortlessly
  hover and fly over short distances, but she is really slow at picking up items.
  Papa is the strongest of the group and can throw enemies and items really far,
  whereas Mama can jump higher than anyone. As aforementioned, each character can
  carry enemies, items, and especially radishes and other vegetables that can be
  pulled out of the ground and used as lethal weapons. The game features a myriad
  of other items, such as bombs (self explanatory), Power blocks (similar to Mario
  Bros's POW blocks that kill all enemies on screen), Stars (temporary
  invincibility), keys (to unlock doors), Hearts (extra health) or the mysterious
  magic lamps that open doors to the Dark World - mirror areas where our heroes
  can find special items or heart containers.
  .
  Doki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven
  chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player
  can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the
  evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save
  each character's progress).
