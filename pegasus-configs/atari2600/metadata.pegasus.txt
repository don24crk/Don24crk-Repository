description:
  This cartridge contains six of the 1 kilobyte entries and one 4 kilobyte entry
  from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the
  games. The games are:
  .
  1. Hunchy: inspired by the Century Electronics game Hunchback, the player takes
  the role of Quasimodo and must rescue Esmeralda from the cathedral of Notre
  Dame. Quasimoto can jump across the roof, avoiding guards and assorted missiles.
  .
  2. Jetman: inspired by the 8-bit computer game Jetpac, the player must fuel a
  rocket but avoid getting shot from an unseen attacker.
  .
  3. Nightrider: the player is running from a hostile government. They are
  pursuing you with a helicopter. Just keep running and watch out for the terrain.
  The farther and longer along the Nightrider goes, the more freedom is worth.
  .
  4. Zirconium: an alien race, not carbon-based but zirconium-based, have invaded
  the galaxy. They have set space mines to protect their mothership. The player
  takes the role of Captain Joe Diamond, and must fight his way through these
  mines and destroy the mothership. Careful about hitting mines, as the ship can
  only take so many blows. Grab any power packs you can.
  .
  5. Rocket Command: magma beings are invading from the inside of a volcano. As
  the rocket commander, the player must destroy these beings' ships before they
  launch into the sky.
  .
  6. M-4: a port of a 1977 Midway arcade game of the same name. The player has
  unlimited lives and 90 seconds to destroy all that is seen for points. Points
  are awarded for hitting the wall, the opponent tank, a car and an airplane. If
  the player or the opponent are hit, the wall is rebuilt and both are returned to
  thier starting points, but the clock never pauses.
  .
  7. Marble Jumper: this is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the board
  of all but 1 marble, with the last one being in the middle. There are 33 squares
  and 16 marbles. The player clears marbles by jumping them vertically or
  horizontally, like in checkers. Diagonal jumps are not allowed.

publisher: Atari
genre: Simulation-Strategie
description:
  Das Spiel ähnelt dem traditionellen Tic-Tac-Toe-Spiel, wird jedoch auf vier
  vertikal gestapelten 4x4-Rastern gespielt. Es ist im Grunde eine computerisierte
  Version des Brettspiels Qubic mit traditioneller Tic-Tac-Toe-Notation und
  Layout. Um zu gewinnen, muss ein Spieler vier seiner Symbole auf vier Feldern
  platzieren, die vertikal, horizontal oder diagonal auf einem einzigen Gitter
  oder gleichmäßig über alle vier Gitter verteilt sind. Dies schafft insgesamt 76
  mögliche Gewinnwege, im Vergleich zu acht möglichen Gewinnwegen auf einem
  Standard-3×3-Brett. Das Spiel hat neun Variationen: Es kann von zwei Spielern
  gegeneinander gespielt werden, oder ein Spieler kann auf einer von acht
  verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsstufen gegen eine eingebaute KI spielen.

  einem "Roboterprogrammierspiel" mit dem Titel "Actionauts". Aufgrund der

  fertiggestellt und wurde erst 2008 der Öffentlichkeit vorgestellt oder
  veröffentlicht.\n
  Das ursprüngliche, scheinbar einfache Puzzlespiel fordert einen einzelnen
  Spieler heraus, mit dem Programmeditor eine Abfolge von Befehlen zu
  konstruieren, um einen Roboter auf dem Bildschirm so zu steuern, dass er den
  "Käse" erreicht. Es ist nicht annähernd so einfach, wie es aussieht!

genre: Shooter-Shooter / Fahrzeug, 3rd. Pers.
description:
  Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one
  another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability.
  Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the
  game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise.
  However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of
  Combat. The game takes place on a different randomly selected battlefield each
  round. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously
  pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick. The mines remain
  active for the duration of the battle, destroying either tank that runs over
  them. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command.
  The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural
  barriers. But as with "Combat", there is no AI for the computer, and the game
  cannot be played solo.

genre: Strategie
description:
  In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain
  landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns
  firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which
  the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction
  and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the
  current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any
  mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun
  will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points
  wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of
  time you have to make a shot.

genre: Strategie
description:
  AStar is a new puzzle game for the Atari 2600 by Aaron Curtis, whose first
  homebrew endeavor was the highly popular Fall Down. AStar is inspired by an old
  calculator game called DStar. The basic idea is to collect all the items
  (cherries on the first level), but it's not as easy as it may seem at first! You
  can only move in a straight line until you hit something. You can then change
  your direction and again move forward until you hit a wall. You also have
  control of a small block to that you can use to help you navigate the level.
  .
  The number of moves you've made is shown at the bottom of the screen. Each level
  has a minimum number of moves required to complete it, and if you go over this
  the display will change color. Completing every level in the minimum number of
  moves (no easy task!) wins the game!
  .
  Includes cartridge and full-color manual. Available in NTSC and PAL television
  formats, please specify above when ordering.

  In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a

  .
  Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire
  button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot
  move onto a space of the same color as he is.
  .
  To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the
  direction to rotate.
  .
  The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest
  moves.\n
  Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it
  rotates, so you don't know what color your on.\n
  Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves
  challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the
  spaces.
  .
  Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.

  The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are

  You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to
  defend it from the invaders. The various Gorgon craft will keep flying by on the
  screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly
  high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough
  before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings
  in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing
  in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been
  destroyed.
  .
  Sounds familiar? It should. Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When
  Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four
  highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out
  for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets
  and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more
  than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of
  these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a
  modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores
  lower per hit and the score font is different.

  galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard
  has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the
  galaxy from the invaders. K’caj technology is much more advanced than the
  technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped
  with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that
  will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your
  mission is a failure, the K’caj will gain control of this vital sector of space,
  allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and
  gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell
  disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands!
  .
  You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which
  travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or
  down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you
  will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the
  middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it
  moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life.
  Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful
  when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a
  life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red,
  blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra
  life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the
  points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.

  Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the
  rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For
  Atari, this is the variation used here:\n
  All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the
  roll of the dice.\n
  No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to
  the bar.\n
  A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he
  wants, after making the 1-2 move.\n
  After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.\n
  If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2
  and choose another doublet.
  .
  Difficulty switches\n
  Right:\n
  A=computer rolls dice for you\n
  B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers\n
  Left:\n

  B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

description:
  You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city)
  in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving
  across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the
  banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot
  pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.
  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite,
  which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.
  .
  Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to
  another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road
  out of town.  By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city.  Each city
  is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.
  .
  There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each
  time you rob one.  Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to
  town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each
  town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling
  in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.

  After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be
  destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add
  a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow

  Bopper.

  Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.
  .
  A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get
  Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.
  .
  Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All
  games have two rounds.
  .
  Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when
  you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.
  .
  Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the
  second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird
  still pops under a chute.
  .
  Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs
  dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the
  first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in
  the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in
  both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned
  correctly.
  .
  Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with
  unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do
  rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch
  the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.
  .
  Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute,
  only when it pops out the bottom.
  .
  Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the
  direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for
  which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game
  ten, the patterns change per round.
  .
  Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

publisher: Atari

description:
  The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased controller for the Atari 2600. It was
  intended for release in 1984. The Mindlink was unique in that you had to move
  the muscles in your head to control the game. These movements would be read by
  infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game. Games would be similar
  to ones that used the paddle controller, but with the Mindlink instead. Testing
  showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to
  play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time,
  Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for
  the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough & Mind Maze.
  .
  Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while
  Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is
  printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work. Neither game would see release
  in a joystick or paddle controlled form in later years, partly due to the
  failing video game industry, partly due to the games' limited appeal.

  and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the
  start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult,
  there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which
  doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to
  hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to
  time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by
  a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy,
  who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will
  also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he
  will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is

developer: First Star Software

genre: Action
description:
  This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.
  .
  In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.\n
  The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all
  on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater.
  He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of
  your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit
  by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.
  .
  The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that
  if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is
  popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle,
  you can bounce on it without getting hurt.
  .
  Game variations\n
  The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.
  .
  Levels\n
  There are 5 waves per level.\n
  Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.\n
  Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be
  turned on before you go to another row.\n
  Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6
  before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.\n
  Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce
  on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on
  again.\n
  Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be
  turned on before you go to another row.\n
  Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6
  before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
  .
  Scoring\n
  You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.\n
  You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points
  even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.\n
  You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what
  level or wave you completed.

  also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the
  levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and
  the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.

  You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil
  eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area.
  .
  To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together,
  dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this
  you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an
  ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall
  to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and
  will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an
  emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which
  will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun
  enemies, allowing you to walk past them.
  .
  Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to
  assemble.

description:
  Another long-lost unreleased prototype has now seen the light of day, thanks to
  a discovery by Alex Handy at a flea market in California. Alex located a cache
  of old EPROMs, later realizing he had come across a copy of Cabbage Patch Kids:
  Adventures in the Park for the Atari 2600, a title released for the ColecoVision
  but which never saw the light of day on the 2600. With the help of long-time
  Atari enthusiast Joe Grand, all of Alex's finds were dumped. The bulk of the
  dumps were ColecoVision related, but the Cabbage Patch game for the 2600 turned
  out to be the find of a lifetime for Atari fans. Alex quickly posted all of the
  dumped binaries on his blog, including 10 different versions of the Cabbage
  Patch game.
  .
  As luck would have it, Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park is an
  impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games. Cabbage
  Patch Kids is a side-scrolling game, similar to Pitfall! in this regard. The
  game consists of various screens that have different obstacles that must be
  overcome in order to proceed to the next screen. These include water-filled
  pits, bouncing balls, floating platforms, bees, and fires. You must complete ten
  screens on each level before a timer runs out. While traversing the screens you
  can also use trampolines to collect objects hidden in the trees for additional
  points.
  .
  Our thanks go out to Alex Handy for graciously sharing all of his impressive
  flea market haul with the classic gaming community.

  same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces
  from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally
  forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your
  pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece,
  you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a
  diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that
  piece then becomes "kinged" allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The
  game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels
  available) or two players against each other.

description:
  The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily,
  there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the
  reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm
  to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a
  meltdown.
  .
  There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red,
  blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the
  robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them
  when they get to the robot arm.
  .
  If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around,
  causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose
  one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating
  fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear
  level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters
  meltdown.

genre: Action
description:
  In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a
  monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of
  several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view
  of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will
  encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of
  your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick
  in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks.
  The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain
  moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more
  choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead
  ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again.
  Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights.
  By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order
  to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time
  limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also
  cause you to lose even more time.

  In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is
  generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty
  setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by
  entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer
  analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct
  digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no
  correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to
  correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also
  included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On
  each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who
  removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the
  stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where
  the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.

  Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive

  This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have
  attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that
  defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break
  through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The
  defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the
  cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press
  fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be
  advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or
  cannons are destroyed, the game is over.
  .
  The Jarvian ships are:
  .
  1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at
  the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.
  .
  2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as
  soon as you can.
  .
  3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your
  cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

  4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he
  doesn't stay long.

  .
  This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just
  tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper
  left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot
  them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another
  game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way
  first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one
  standing.
  .
  If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile
  that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two
  shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several
  seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect
  repairs.
  .
  There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through,
  walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you
  can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.

publisher: Answer Software
genre: Strategie
description:
  Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released,
  but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it
  on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while
  it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on
  how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've
  determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick
  up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so
  many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players
  pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.
  .
  Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing
  players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a
  captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border
  of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's
  Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The
  object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board
  where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your
  captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first
  player to remove all of his pieces wins the game.
  .
  Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced
  action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had
  been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the
  video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer
  Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in
  dust, never even reaching store shelves.

  The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your
  Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma,
  which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or
  right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must
  begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay
  a little more
  .
  The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom
  left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left,
  all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space
  station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the
  bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the
  planet's orbit decays a little more.
  .
  If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper
  right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you
  shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000
  points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start
  the Voyage again, only faster.

description:
  You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when
  suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then
  begin haphazardly making their nest.
  .
  Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You
  simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be
  energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a
  block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on
  the screen.
  .
  If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a
  block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not
  be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a
  termite, you lose a life.
  .
  Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right
  side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the
  top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.
  .
  To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is
  not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you
  will stay at that angle until you rotate again.
  .
  The points are:\n
  Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point\n
  Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2
  points\n
  Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points\n
  Shooting an energized block=1 point

description:
  As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a
  helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As
  Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot
  climb down.\n
  While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any
  window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window
  closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of
  a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber
  every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers,
  including:
  .
  1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.\n
  2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant
  substance.\n
  3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.\n
  4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.\n
  5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.\n
  6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands
  against the windows.
  .
  The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will
  encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he
  falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and
  will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger
  will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face
  the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable
  musical themes.
  .
  Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting
  carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every
  ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts
  reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can
  lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches
  it.

description:
  You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship
  IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must
  destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the
  other two are destroyed.
  .
  IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to
  bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant
  game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short
  distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid
  getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see
  Game variations below)
  .
  You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire
  button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the
  torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't
  moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.
  .
  As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable
  sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through
  the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15
  seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also
  lose points (see Scoring below).
  .
  After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be
  visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center
  generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.
  .
  You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits
  you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.
  .
  Game variations\n
  After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your
  difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.
  .
  The difficulty settings are:\n
  Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are
  small, you have a repair crew.\n
  Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are
  normal, you have a repair crew.\n
  Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments
  are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from
  fireball strikes are never regained.
  .
  The difficulty switches are not used.\n
  After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the
  game.
  .
  Scoring\n
  Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the
  screen, up to a maximum of 6.\n
  Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the
  first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points,
  etc.\n
  Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points\n
  Destroy the center generator=5000 points\n
  Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than
  zero.

  You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around

  There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a
  line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will
  try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you
  run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift
  into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will
  explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your
  drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an
  section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you
  gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off
  the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.

  locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the
  bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near
  the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid
  to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump
  out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to
  chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows;

  Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series

  Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day.  Atari
  advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made,
  so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo
  was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be
  the reason why it was never released.

game: Eli's Ladder
file: ./Eli's Ladder (USA).a26
developer: Simage
publisher: Simage
genre: Lernspiel
description:
  This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and
  counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by
  solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer
  choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press
  the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more
  answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.
  .
  The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left
  joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game
  and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.
  .
  The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right
  difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be
  selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch
  returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on
  the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in
  a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.
  .
  There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game
  type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as
  needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a
  plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches
  the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next
  problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch.
  If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting
  apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type
  three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer
  selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.

game: Elk Attack
file: ./Elk Attack (USA) (Proto).a26
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of
  deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds
  of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at
  all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric
  Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably
  would have changed the name had it been published.
  .
  Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.
  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and
  destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter
  strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your
  Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the
  board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and
  increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible
  will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its
  best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down
  the worms.
  .
  Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful
  as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you
  can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to
  accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked
  into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to
  avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.

  You begin in a maze on the lower left corner. You can move anywhere but cannot
  pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a
  spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the
  joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which
  begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a
  box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once
  you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used
  the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.

  a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or
  right.

  Scoring\n
  You score ten points for each death ship you destroy\n

  When the Personal Computer Museum first discovered Extra Terrestrials, the find
  itself was enough to send shockwaves through the Atari community. Not only had a
  previously unknown (but commercially released) title surfaced but it has also
  been recognized as the only Canadian developed Atari 2600 game. The group was
  hoping to capitalize on the video game market that was booming at the time. They
  had hoped to get the game out for the 1983 Christmas season, but delays in the
  programming precluded that and the game missed the Christmas window. After it
  was finally finished in early 1984, Peter remembers taking the game out to
  retailers door to door to purchase copies of the game. They had no distributor,
  and by then the video game market had collapsed.

  player controls an alien as the Pac-Man stand-in, eating as many dots as they
  can throughout the stage. Chasing them is the other player as a human who, like
  the ghosts, is trying to catch and destroy them.

  such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which
  can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some
  phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!)
  and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it
  past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot
  can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too
  many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over.
  Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of

description:
  Farmyard Fun is a PAL conversion. Originally release in Europe by a Taiwan
  company.
  .
  In Farmyard Fun you control Tom the egg thief who roams the farmyard collecting
  eggs. The eggs are guarded by hens that defeat Tom with a simple touch.
  Successfully collecting all eggs advances the player to the next level where the
  eggs are displayed in different locations. The hens also become faster and
  harder to avoid. Nice graphics and a quirky entry (Tom arrives riding on the
  back of a swan) make Farmyard Fun an offbeat winner.

  can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and
  rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the
  worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to
  estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker
  is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the
  building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out
  the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't
  run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire
  spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the

  location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may
  appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how
  many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start
  again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible
  in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games:
  in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and
  whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games,
  players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available
  which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move,
  or add an invisible wall around the playfield.

description:
  "The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust." ...with
  these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, "Otter" planted the seeds for
  the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong
  Deathmatch... but with a "Flap" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent
  the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points
  win (3 points in a "poorlords" game).
  .
  FlapPing features two primary game variations, a "classic pong" mode which
  resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and "poorlords", where each player must
  defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play
  another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl
  of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element
  to the gameplay!
  .
  FlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for
  his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong
  trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so
  it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and
  manual designed by Dave Exton.

  pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part

  .
  You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods,
  and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the
  warriors.
  .
  You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator
  will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the
  debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.
  .
  If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when
  it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to
  warn you of the shield leaving.
  .
  The scoring is as follows:\n
  10 points = Debris\n
  25 points = Patrol Ship\n
  70 points = Rescued Spaceman\n
  100 points = Disrupter Generator
  .
  You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second,
  300 for the third and so on.
  .
  You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do
  that, right?

game: Frog Pond
file: ./Frog Pond (USA) (Proto).a26
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  The history behind Frog Pond is a little hazy, it's either a victim of bad
  timing or of management/programmer dispute.  The premise behind Frog pond is
  simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its
  tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and
  total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at
  small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The
  problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults
  to play, and Frog Pond is no exception.
  .
  If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact
  copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies
  under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely
  coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.
  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game,
  expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more
  memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond
  was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards.
  .
  As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire
  button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an
  insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several
  different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points.
  .
  While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still
  don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll
  fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends.

  Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters
  game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game
  market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and
  Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new
  VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie
  of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the
  apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground
  tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of "mood slime." Ghosts will
  attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the
  Ghostbuster's "courage" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be
  replenished by picking up "elixir" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's
  second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of
  New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with
  her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of "mood slime"
  to keep the statue moving.

  the roof through the chimney. Now that you're on the roof you must build a
  bridge to a nearby tree while fighting off cats and birds that want you for a
  tasty treat! Once in the tree, you need to evade all the dangerous creatures in
  the forest (will you ever get a break?) And if you do escape the forest, you
  enter a cave where you must fight off your most fearsome enemy yet!
  .
  Once you defeat the boss, to your dismay you are captured again and put back in
  the oven too cook some more, and this time the heat has been turned up! Will you

description:
  Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two
  players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is
  complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't
  have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is
  controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by
  the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally
  reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two
  different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the
  amount of power lost in the rough or sand.

  Gorf ist ein ähnliches Spiel wie Space Invaders, außerirdische Schiffe nähern
  sich in ihrer bedrohlichen Reihenformation immer näher.
  .
  Das Spiel selbst besteht aus vier Leveln:\n
  Level 1: Du verteidigst dich hinter einem Verteidigungsschild gegen einen
  Alien-Angriff. Das Level ist eine Draufsicht, mit deinem Schiff und Schild auf
  der einen Seite und den Aliens auf der anderen Seite.\n
  Level 2: Es ähnelt der ersten, nur dass der Verteidigungsschild weg ist und die
  Feinde im Gegensatz zu diesen Reihenformationen dazu neigen, über die Ebene zu
  stürzen. In diesem Level tauchen auch Bonusschiffe auf.\n
  Level 3: Diese lässt Sie den Hyperraum betreten. Ihr einziges Ziel ist es, bis
  zum Ende Ihrer Reise zu überleben. Der Aussichtspunkt wechselt von einer Ansicht
  von oben nach unten zu einer Ansicht hinter dem Schiff, und tatsächlich steuern
  Sie Ihrem Ziel zu. Außerirdische Schiffe, die in kreisförmiger Formation
  fliegen, versuchen, Sie aufzuhalten.\n
  Level 4: Es ähnelt wieder dem ersten, mit einigen wesentlichen Unterschieden. Du
  kämpfst nicht gegen eine Welle von Feinden, sondern gegen eine einzelnes
  Mutterschiff mit einer glühenden Schwachstelle. Wenn Sie die Schwachstelle
  treffen, wird sie sofort zerstört. Das Mutterschiff hat auch denselben Schild,
  der dir im ersten Level gehörte.\n
  Das Beenden des Spiels erhöht Ihren Rang und beginnt das Spiel auf Level 1 mit
  einer höheren Spielgeschwindigkeit für mehr Herausforderung.

  The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With
  each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a
  powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by
  taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his
  control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three
  to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit
  all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the
  core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and
  the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make
  sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will
  be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the
  next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five

  of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.

description:
  Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your
  goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine
  lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your
  eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your
  mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout.
  Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to
  lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a
  magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its
  inhabitants.
  .
  The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the
  rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The
  mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it
  (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To
  reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited
  supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be
  surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!
  .
  You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a
  strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn,
  you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all
  three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The
  game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the
  fewer matches the better the score!

file: ./Home Run (USA).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Sport-Sport / Baseball
description:
  The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the
  option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the
  joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is
  hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the
  orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you
  can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider
  that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller
  button so they stop at their current base.
  .
  The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine
  innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after
  four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a
  ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another
  runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between
  bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is
  by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field
  players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of
  the first three.

game: Human Cannonball : Cannon Man

developer: Atari

genre: Strategie
description:
  In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land
  in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position,
  angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful
  landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are
  included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the
  player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of
  these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more
  challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will
  make your timing more critical.

  successor to, the Atari 2600's Hunchy, and though superficially drawing thematic
  inspiration from Hunchback II: Quasimodo's Revenge, its basic gameplay has been
  more directly derived from Chuckie Egg and Miner 2049er.
  .
  The gameplay in question involves a progression through 14 levels\n
  of platforming to impress Esmeralda, climbing up and down ladders to gather
  bells while avoiding guards and a regular stream of missiles being fired in from
  the sides.

description:
  In a world wracked with internecine tanks-falling-out-of-the-sky-in-the-desert
  warfare, you are the elitest of the elite, the crackest of the crack, the
  creamiest of the crop. Inexplicably falling yet again onto a mountainside
  undamaged, you open the hatch of your main battle tank to look out on the serene
  desert landscape turned warzone. As the early morning sun glints off the barrel,
  you begin to wonder whether it's all worth it...whether it will ever end...and
  whether you will ever see your family again. Suddenly the stillness of the
  morning is shattered by a shrill whistling sound from high above which gets
  louder by the second. You swing the hatch shut, turn to your crewmates, and
  shout that all too familiar refrain: 'Incoming!'
  .
  'Incoming!' is an artillery shooting game that can be played between two
  players, or between one player and the computer. The game is played in rounds.
  Each round of the game features two tanks, one red and one green, squaring off
  against one another across a side-view 2-dimensional battlefield. The object is
  to destroy the other player's tank by lobbing shells across the board and
  hitting him. Players alternate firing at one another until one player hits the
  other, at which point that player wins the round and the next round begins. The
  first player to score a predetermined number of rounds wins the game.

  Auto oft rutscht und das Lenken erschwert wird. Beim Taggen ist ein Spieler „es“

description:
  Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is
  an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600
  library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across
  the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of
  each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you
  must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player
  must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally
  stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the
  sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in
  its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop,
  requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to
  move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around
  the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship.
  Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult
  to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the
  tile they are on when they explode.

developer: Mystique
publisher: Mystique
genre: Action
description:
  This is a double-ender cartridge with Jungle Fever on one end and Knight on the
  Town on the other.
  .
  Jungle Fever is just a gender-reversed version of Burning Desire in which your
  boyfriend is being held for sacrifice and you must rescue him while avoiding the
  rocks thrown by the amazons.
  .
  Knight on the Town involves you (the knight in question) building a bridge over
  the moat to reach the princess. You must contend with a castration-minded
  alligator and a troll. Also, if you select it, the bird above you will drop fire
  to remove one of your bridge sections. Once you reach your lady, you can get
  your "reward".

game: Jungle Hunt

developer: Taito

genre: Action-Plattform
description:
  Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater
  difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these
  adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely
  Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!
  .
  The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines
  without plummeting to your doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch
  of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  Fortunately, you have a knife to fight
  back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, you face a battle
  against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all
  these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is
  armed with a wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?
  .
  Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile
  phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform
  games.

description:
  Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford,
  known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi
  Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being
  released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little
  creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your
  Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine
  Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should
  one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy
  Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The
  baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get
  tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages.
  Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy
  at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also
  somewhat fun.

game: Kamikaze Saucers
file: ./Kamikaze Saucers (USA) (Proto).a26
publisher: Syncro
genre: Shoot'em Up
description:
  Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never
  even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to
  be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.
  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take
  out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.
  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one
  wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.
  .
  Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon
  Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your
  oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a
  timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will
  come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before
  they crash into you you'll lose a life.
  .
  Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.
  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters,
  the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on
  the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from
  the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like
  Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So
  shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the
  center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used
  to, but actually makes the game more challenging.

  you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more
  objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.

publisher: Champ Games
genre: Action-Action / Labyrinth
description:
  An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players
  control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the
  food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze,
  there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and
  escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In
  the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out
  enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around
  the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so
  later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game
  brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.
  .
  In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of
  powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly
  both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy
  creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay.
  Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right
  time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses.
  However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few
  points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which
  are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow
  and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to
  that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA".
  Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word,
  SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.
  .
  Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the
  X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are
  lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.

  Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic
  computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy

  guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and
  deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time
  you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields
  energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods
  which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss
  one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with
  a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the
  next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by
  disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the
  force fields.

description:
  During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare.
  Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before
  detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded
  bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers,
  it is your job to defuse these bombs.
  .
  First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is
  defusing time.
  .
  On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the
  numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If
  the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying.
  .
  On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls
  the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the
  slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what
  slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you
  can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and
  hope you disarm in time.
  .
  The possible ranks are:\n
  Lance Corporal\n
  Corporal\n
  Sargent\n
  Staff Sargent\n
  Warrant Officer\n
  Second Lieutenant\n
  First Lieutenant\n
  Captain
  .
  At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance
  Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First
  Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.
  .
  Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight
  levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage,
  you are demoted a level in rank.
  .
  You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes
  while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.
  .
  You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.

game: Looping

developer: Apollo, Inc.
publisher: Coleco Industries, Inc.
genre: Action
description:
  Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name.\n
  As the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that
  your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right
  movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch
  and start its loop, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy
  to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.
  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen
  it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major
  inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough.\n
  Each level begins on the runway of the airfield where you must start the game by
  successfully taking off (just pull down on the stick). There are three possible
  missions depending on what level you are playing: Destroy the Terminal, Destroy
  the Missile, or Destroy the Terminal and Missile.  To destroy your target,
  you're going to have to shoot through the blocks that make up the structure,
  which as you may have guessed is easier said than done.  Since your plane is
  constantly moving at high speed you can only take a few shots at your target
  before passing it over. Also making your life miserable are several balloons
  which bounce around the screen at alarming speed, although you can shoot these
  balloons.\n
  The Pipe Maze is a huge maze of pipes which you must fly though in order to
  reach "The End".  The first room in this maze is fairly open, with several paths
  to take to the next room. The second room is very similar to the first, except
  it contains a "monster" which bounces around the top right corner.  Destroy the
  monster quickly and move to the final room.\n
  The final room is one of the most difficult areas of the game. To reach "The
  End" you must maneuver past three bouncing balls that are blocking the entrances
  to the small inner room. After touching the finish line you will begin a new and
  more difficult level.

  You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel.
  However, the carousel has gone out of control and is tossing luggage everywhere!
  You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes

  luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two
  difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage
  with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations
  are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive
  suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game
  immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase
  control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the
  direction your opponents suitcases travel.

  M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a

  .
  In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the
  Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are
  two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next
  round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield
  with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by
  enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are
  required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is
  very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.
  .
  Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999
  points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each
  selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.

  In Masters of the Universe steuerst du He-Man, während er in zwei verschiedenen
  Arten von Arcade-Actionszenen gegen Skeletor kämpft. Im ersten Teil des Spiels
  steuerst du den Windräuber, der in Richtung Schloss Grayskull fliegt. Sie haben
  nur eine begrenzte Menge Treibstoff, um Ihr Ziel zu erreichen. Außerdem fliegen
  zahlreiche Feuerbälle über den Bildschirm, um Sie zu stoppen, und Skeletor rennt
  über den Boden. Der Wind Raider ist mit Bomben und Kanonen ausgestattet, mit
  denen Sie sich vor den Feuerbällen schützen und Bonuspunkte sammeln können, wenn
  Sie Skeletor treffen. Der zweite Teil des Spiels findet zu Fuß statt. Wenn du in
  der Nähe des Schlosses gelandet bist, muss He-Man Skeletor verfolgen. Skeletor
  wird zahlreiche Blitzschläge abfeuern, die mit einem Schild blockiert werden
  können. Hier gibt es ein Zeitlimit und du musst alle Bildschirme überwinden und
  Skeletor fangen, bevor die Zeit abläuft. Wenn Sie erfolgreich sind, wird das
  Spiel mit einem härteren Schwierigkeitsgrad wiederholt.

  challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are
  caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your

  You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun
  is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a
  sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.
  .
  When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle.
  When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.
  .
  The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched
  rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy
  fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will
  see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is
  in trouble.
  .
  Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of
  fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all
  the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not
  want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points
  and ten gallons of fuel.
  .
  Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points.\n
  Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points.\n
  Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If
  you get them all, you get one more point.\n
  Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of
  fuel each BUT if all the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any
  more points that round and will lose a life at the end of that round.

  Spieler erschossen werden. Das im Spiel abgebildete Raumschiff des Spielers ist
  eine Kreuzung zwischen der U.S.S. Enterprise und klingonischer Schlachtkreuzer

game: Meltdown
file: ./Meltdown (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Videa
publisher: 20th Century Fox
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for
  the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed
  but was never released. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it
  was never seen again after the show closed.\n
  Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.
  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor
  agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off
  some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's
  electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will
  blow!\n
  As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool
  down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two
  tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark
  jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the
  Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the
  fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to
  take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.\n
  The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.
  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the
  center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor
  will be saved. Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get
  more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move
  faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.\n
  Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical
  style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to
  put down.

  Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas

  of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an
  old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the
  lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

  Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around
  the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If
  this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

  You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all
  your comrades.
  .
  As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare
  parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or
  blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the
  bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a
  monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.
  .
  To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any
  level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving
  through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without
  holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to
  avoid monsters.
  .
  To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters
  to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will
  destroy you and the monster.
  .
  In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the
  robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead
  of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to
  another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore

developer: Sears

genre: Sport-Sport / Golf
description:
  This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to
  refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in
  a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your
  path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be
  played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.
  .
  Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole
  half-course.  Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit
  the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the
  cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.
  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned
  to it.  So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned
  to each hole.
  .
  Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the
  strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many
  strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game
  continues on to the next hole.

  Raketenbasis ist es Ihre Aufgabe, diese zu verteidigen. Eine Vielzahl von
  feindlichen Waffen und Flugzeugen wird eintreffen und versuchen, die sechs
  Städte am unteren Bildschirmrand zu zerstören. Sie müssen Raketen abfeuern, um
  die ankommenden Waffen zu zerstören. Wenn etwas durchkommt, könnte eine Ihrer
  Städte zerstört werden. Wenn alle Städte zerstört sind, ist das Spiel vorbei. In
  jedem Level haben Sie nur eine begrenzte Menge an Munition, also stellen Sie
  sicher, dass die meisten (wenn nicht alle) Ihrer Schüsse genau sind, sonst
  könnte Ihnen die Munition ausgehen und Ihre Städte in Gefahr bringen! Im Laufe
  der Levels gibt es immer mehr feindliche Waffen zu zerstören, die immer
  schneller eintreffen.

description:
  Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their
  cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.
  .
  The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire
  for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the
  launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each
  level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their
  cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient
  number of alien spacecraft.
  .
  The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and
  energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get
  around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles
  launched at the sides of the screen.

  which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are
  various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar
  satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue
  six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the

  moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help
  out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will

  Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to
  locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There
  are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown.
  First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have
  enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere
  within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you
  which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds
  and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the
  entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull
  spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you
  have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out.
  To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can
  steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of
  the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region
  of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a
  time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!

  deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the
  blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks,
  there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the
  door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the
  unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit
  a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete
  word, and you will earn an extra life.
  .
  The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two
  skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and
  replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become
  trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.

  important is that getting hit by one costs a life. So don't get hit by one. Oh,
  and while all this is happening your score is counting down at a pretty rapid
  clip, so no dilly-dallying.
  .
  Once you've secured your steed it's time to ride him (or her) through a

  clear the skies of hail three times you finally reach your destination, the City
  of Silence. Here you navigate through tight passages to deliver your package to

  overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to
  move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a
  magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited
  supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to  fall (be
  careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of
  the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you
  accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also
  be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have
  no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.

description:
  A classic Asterix & Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix
  and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living
  daylights out of Roman soldiers.
  .
  The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by
  running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good
  ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.
  .
  If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn
  "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some
  good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be
  ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.
  .
  There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small
  centurions. Centurions are worth more points.

  Off The Wall ist ein Arcade-Actionspiel mit Gameplay im Breakout-Stil. Sie
  steuern Kung Fu Lu, dessen Mission es ist, eine mysteriöse, böse Wand zu
  zerstören, indem Sie einen springenden Ball in die Steine werfen, aus denen die
  Wand besteht. Wenn die Steine vom Ball getroffen werden, werden sie zerstört.
  Oben auf dem Bildschirm befindet sich ein mystischer Drache, der die Wand
  bewacht. Jedes Level kann abgeschlossen werden, indem entweder alle Ziegel in
  der Wand zerstört oder der Drache sechsmal mit dem Ball getroffen wird. Sobald
  der erste Level abgeschlossen ist, erscheint auch eine Amsel direkt unter der
  Wand auf dem Bildschirm. Die Amsel lenkt den Ball ab und versucht, dir in die
  Quere zu kommen, um deine Mission zu erschweren. Von Zeit zu Zeit fällt ein
  magisches Zeichen nach unten, das Ihnen besondere Kräfte verleiht, wenn es
  gefangen wird. Diese können den Ball magnetisch machen und Ihrem Spieler folgen,
  Ihnen ein größeres Paddel geben oder den Ball explosiv machen und größere
  Ziegelbrocken herausnehmen. Du beginnst das Spiel auf einem Fertigkeitslevel von
  Bauer und steigst jedes Mal im Rang auf, wenn vier Wellen von Steinen geräumt
  sind. Sie verlieren jedes Mal ein Leben, wenn der Ball vom unteren Rand des
  Bildschirms fällt, und das Spiel endet, wenn Sie alle fünf Ihrer Leben
  verlieren.

developer: Bally Midway

description:
  This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and
  shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive
  Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid
  flights goes into a spiraling pattern.
  .
  There is no end to this game.  Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the
  highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.
  .
  You control a small triangle that is your ship.  The ship can turn, move forward
  (with thrusters) and fire.  Movement is one of the games challenges; once the
  ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite
  direction and use the thrusters.  While doing that, the ship is unable to fire
  toward anything it is in motion toward.
  .
  Bouncing also comes into play during movement.  When the ship hits the side of
  the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.  You don't have
  control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control,
  before you run into an enemy ship and die.

  direction you are traveling and thrust.
  .
  First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you
  must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must

  around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed
  hurdle and do it again to continue.

game: Peek-A-Boo
file: ./Peek-A-Boo (USA) (Proto).a26
publisher: Atari
genre: Lernspiel
description:
  According to Atari, Peek-A-Boo was to be a revolutionary new video activity
  based on the familiar concepts of Peek-a-Boo and Hide 'n' Seek.  It was supposed
  to teach important concepts such as spatial orientation, direction, and memory
  that build a child's self-esteem and teach them to have fun on the 2600.\n
  Since Peek-A-Boo was intended for very young children the gameplay is very
  simple.  The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in
  and out from behind a square.  Depending on the game selected the various
  elements of the game change slightly.  The square may be a single block, a
  rectangle, or four colored squares.  The cat may move far away from the square,
  or he may barely move half his body out.  The cat may move rapidly in and out
  from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square.  There are eight
  different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.\n
  Before starting the game, the first thing you must do is turn the kids
  controller sideways to the left (so the top row read 3 6 9 #, middle row reads 2
  5 8 0, and bottom row reads 1 4 7 *).\n
  -Game 1: Single BlocknnThis is the easiest of all the games.  All of the buttons
  work to move Seymour behind the block or out from behind it in various
  directions.\n
  -Game 2: Horizontal BarnnIn this game the top row of buttons (3 6 9 #) moves
  Seymour up, the bottom row (1 4 7 *) moves Seymour down, and the middle row (2 5
  8 0) gives you an error sound.  As with all the other game variations, all of
  the buttons work to move Seymour behind the line.\n
  -Game 3: Vertical BarnnIn this game buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 move Seymour to the left
  while buttons 7 8 9 * 0 # move him to the right.\n
  -Game 4: Single BlocknnIn this game buttons 6 and 9 move Seymour up, 4 and 7
  move him down, 1 2 3 moves him left, and * 0 # moves him right.  Buttons 5 and 8
  give the error sound.\n
  -Game 5: Four BlocksnnIn this game you have to press the right buttons depending
  on which block Seymour is behind.  Buttons 3 and 6 move him from behind the top
  left block, 9 and # move him from behind the top right block, 1 and 4 move him
  from behind the bottom left block, and 7 and * move him from behind bottom right
  block.  All of the middle buttons 2580 give the error sound.\n
  -Game 6: Four Colored BlocksnnIn this game the buttons are assigned different
  colors that correspond to the colored blocks.  Buttons 1 2 3 moves Seymour from
  behind the green block, 456 for the red block, 7 8 9 for the tan block, and 0 *
  # moves Seymour from behind the blue block.\n
  -Games 7 & 8: 4 Blocks/4 Colored BlocksnnThese last two games are a bit of a
  mystery.  Hitting any button moves Seymour in various directions and only the
  two middle buttons (5 and 8) give the error sound when moving him out from
  behind the blocks.  Perhaps these games aren't finished or you need the mind of
  a child to understand them (you'd think I'd be qualified for that).\n
  Peek-A-Boo holds a minor place in Atari history as being the first video game
  designed with a psychologist.

  The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and
  looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The
  second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's
  practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with
  the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles
  to stop them.
  .
  The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in
  each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet.
  The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy
  bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits
  the player's energy base.

genre: Strategie-Puzzle
description:
  Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of
  symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you
  need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in
  a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and
  complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear.
  Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything
  onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto
  the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to
  create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a
  time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a
  life; lose all lives and the game is over.
  .
  In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the
  screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy
  several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help
  out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't
  be moved.

  This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing
  which character you want.\n
  For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's
  Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.\n
  While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space
  chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way
  to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the
  chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits
  Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to
  time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for
  points also.
  .

  Hitting a chicken on...\n
  Row one=10 points\n
  Row two=20 points\n
  Row three=50 points\n
  Row four=70 points\n
  Row five=100 points\n
  Hitting Gonzo=300 points\n
  Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus
  .
  If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been
  ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the
  bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you
  touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus
  time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't
  dawdle.
  .
  Scoring\n
  Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points\n
  Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points
  .
  If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The
  Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by
  robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges,
  throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you
  fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The
  direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are
  hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot,
  you lose a life.
  .
  Scoring\n
  You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.\n
  Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points\n
  Escaping the mine=1000 points

game: Planet of the Apes
file: ./Planet of the Apes (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Spectravision
publisher: 20th Century Fox
genre: Action
description:
  The action takes place over several screens: Deserts; Forests; the Apes'
  Village; a River Crossing; Subterranean Caverns; and the climactic Statue of
  Liberty scene from the film. There are three different kinds of apes in this
  game: chimpanzees - these little guys are harmless and can be touched without
  fear; orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the chimpanzees,
  touching them will get you captured; gorillas are the most dangerous of all the
  apes, not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.\n
  You must keep an eye on your 'life energy' (which is diminished whenever you are
  shot) and 'escapes' (which allow you to escape the cages, but also cost you life
  energy). When the life energy hits zero, the game is over. In a worst-case
  scenario, you may get trapped in a cage after you've run out of escapes, unable
  to do anything but wait until the apes shoot you to death. Your ultimate goal is
  to reach the Statue of Liberty level, at which point your health and escape
  ability will be recharged, and the game starts over at a higher difficulty
  level.\n
  -The Forest/The RivernnYou start out in a forest with several apes after you.
  You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep
  on coming it's best to run for it. There are also pits scattered throughout the
  forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly.
  Your goal is to cross the river to the south - only going south will bring you
  towards the Forbidden Zone. Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move
  through without any trouble - it may be that the river was going to be deadly
  and a bridge put across it in the early prototype.\n
  -The Village/PrisonnnIf you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla you end up here.
  When captured, you're treated to a newly-added full-screen graphic of a man
  behind bars. You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is
  cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around. It's very easy to escape and
  be captured again right away. You'll also want to escape from the cage as
  quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while you're trapped
  in the cage. Moving south will bring you to the desert.\n
  -The DesertnnAfter the village you'll encounter a large featureless desert
  (formerly the ?Forbidden Zone'). There are more apes here than in any other
  zone, so you'll have to be on your guard. Moving south will bring you to the
  caverns.\n
  The CavernsnnThe caverns are the last obstacles on your way to the human
  stronghold. There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but unfortunately
  the caverns are a giant maze. You'll also slowly loose life points as you
  traverse the caves. There are several ways out of the caves but not every exit
  will lead you to the stronghold. If you take the wrong path through the caves
  you'll end up back on the forest screen. Hurry, you are close to reaching your
  goal!\n
  The Statue of LibertynnOnce you reach the Statue of Liberty there's a
  newly-added ending which is impressive. You'll also get a brief glimpse of the
  original ending, which looks pretty pathetic by comparison. The screen will
  begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the
  background scrolls through all the screens you've crossed. After this you will
  start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. Each new
  difficulty level has a few changes: the apes will do an extra point of damage
  when they shoot you; the apes move faster; more apes appear on the screen at
  once and come out more often; the bonus points for reaching the Statue of
  Liberty increases by 100.

description:
  In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role
  of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.
  .
  The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in
  a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the
  ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder,
  near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they
  splat on the ground instead.
  .
  The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.
  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them
  jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus
  points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)
  .
  The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have
  reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float
  upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves
  are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons
  wolves in packs.

  You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the

  find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you
  control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the
  loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you:
  questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot
  holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From
  time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you
  jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for!
  If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can
  move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find
  the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to
  finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a
  unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to
  complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the
  gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum,
  or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a
  time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case
  before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a
  different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks
  so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases,
  several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and
  how high you can jump.

  Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay,
  but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored
  blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of
  the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of
  blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to
  rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to
  change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight
  line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round.
  Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures
  (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a
  different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color
  then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a
  creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase
  Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to
  find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the
  playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To
  help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the
  enemies become frozen temporarily.

  vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor
  will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will
  run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into
  the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging,
  you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser
  ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and
  catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the
  captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game
  is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail

  the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and
  some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by
  using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out
  which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;
  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms
  you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal
  with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against
  them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission,
  you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later

  screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is
  now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to
  that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you
  jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the
  bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no
  points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as
  many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach
  the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the
  game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points
  wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a
  magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to
  temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps;
  pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one
  can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end
  of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up,
  so be careful!

  You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make
  like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and
  across the ledges without losing life and limb.
  .
  You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to
  the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will
  lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally
  as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the
  turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to
  ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the
  screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he
  will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace
  your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of
  Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a
  mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back
  at the beginning only harder.

  Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie
  of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the
  Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison.
  Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way
  to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room
  you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the
  secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the
  Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your
  way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark
  and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves
  Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows
  you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different
  locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden)
  which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or
  gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to
  unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the
  game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your
  progress, and of course numerous snakes!

game: Rainbow Invaders
file: ./Rainbow Invaders (USA) (Unl).a26
publisher: AtariAge
genre: Action
description:
  It's the year 3006, and the evil “Rainbow Invaders” from the planet “Pacco”, are
  headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980’s arcade
  games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans!
  You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to
  save Earth! Good luck!
  .
  This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there
  are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they
  go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up.
  Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the
  similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship
  does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned,
  it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move
  or fire for a second.
  .
  Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of
  sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.
  .
  The Special Shots do the following:
  .
  1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds\n
  2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a
  different Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a
  different Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds\n
  5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a
  different Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a
  different Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds\n
  8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second\n
  9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds\n
  10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated
  invader could appear. And your “Shoot Abort” option, wherein when you shoot
  again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty
  seconds\n
  11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second\n
  12. Invaders’ electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a
  different Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different
  Special Shot or lose your current life.\n
  14. Your shots don’t stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the
  top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds\n
  15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it immediately, every
  few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds\n
  16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it before the bonus
  expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten
  seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life

  You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left

  the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you
  larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned,
  though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

  1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or\n

description:
  Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a
  nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core
  at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming
  throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of
  which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need
  to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As
  each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less
  and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to
  prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To
  help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is
  placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of
  your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make
  it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of
  control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy
  an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will
  shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both
  sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.

  As the Pharoh's Son,  it is up to the player to lift the curse of Anubis, God of
  the Dead, by reaching the Temple of Ra, and solving the riddle of the Sphinx.
  .
  Armed with a sling and a pile of rocks, the Prince must navigate past thieves
  and scorpions on his journey.  He can trade with wandering nomads, dig for
  buried treasure, make offerings to the gods, or seek counsel and healing with
  Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood.

  Great care must be exercised in his journey, for the Prince can weaken from
  thirst, which can be be replenished at an oasis or from certain treasures.  He
  will also sustain wounds from the hostile creatures of the land, including
  Anubis himself.
  .
  Once the Prince visits the various temples of the desert and makes his
  offerings, he must choose to make the correct offering (or offerings) to the
  Temple of Ra.  Choose wisely, and the Prince is rewarded.  Choose poorly, and
  the Prince loses inner strength points, and Egypt remains cursed.

description:
  You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of
  taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid
  II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few
  additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a
  successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean
  which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from
  the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next
  you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you
  finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet,
  for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After
  completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In
  addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability
  to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly
  low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.

  There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything

  first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of
  tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete

  difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will
  alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to
  the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly.
  Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your
  targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when
  visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites,
  such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it
  will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.

genre: Action-Plattform / Jump'n'Run-Plattform
description:
  Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and
  pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to
  climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step
  above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The
  mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which
  he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which
  will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work
  horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing
  diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat
  monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth
  extra points.
  .
  Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he
  is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are
  climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to
  "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope.
  Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.
  .
  There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the
  peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies
  and power-ups located in different places.

game: Rocky & Bullwinkle
file: ./Rocky & Bullwinkle (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Steve Crandall
publisher: M Network
genre: Action
description:
  According to the catalog entry: "Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris
  and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables. While Boris uses
  "Upsidasium" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky
  must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives
  them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping."  Now I know the show didn't exactly make
  sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when
  they came up with this plot?
  .
  .
  Twisted plot aside, Rocky & Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which
  you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they
  float up to Natasha.  R&B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles
  Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying
  Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent
  muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure
  to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on
  the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two
  treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to
  75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's
  another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this
  timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting
  different game variations.

  planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your
  planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy
  the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must
  destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot.
  You are the Saboteur.
  .
  On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots
  and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons.
  While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile,
  the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the
  top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your
  interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to
  Warhead Assembly.

  There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The
  good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you
  do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt.
  Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots
  off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying
  to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy
  the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you
  must destroy the warhead one-on-one.
  .
  In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course,
  the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix
  that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it
  will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to
  the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.

game: Save Mary!
file: ./Save Mary! (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  Save Mary! was one of those 2600 revival titles that should have been released
  but was ultimately lost when Atari closed its Atari 2600 operations in 1990.
  Save Mary! may have been in development longer than any other Atari 2600 game
  (over two years according to some sources).  One reason for this was Atari
  management constantly making changes to an already complex game, but another
  reason for the long development cycle was that programmer Tod Frye (of Pac-Man
  fame) may only have been working part time for Atari at the time and was also
  working on another unreleased 2600 game Shooting Arcade.  No matter what the
  reasons were it's a shame Save Mary! never got released, as it's a fun and
  highly original game.\n
  The game title says it all, the goal of the game is to "Save Mary!".  Apparently
  Mary is a rather stupid girl who has somehow got herself stuck in a canyon
  that's rapidly filling with water (don't you hate it when that happens?)  Using
  only a crane and several odd shaped blocks you must build a platform for Mary to
  climb onto and make it high enough so you can hoist her out with the crane.
  However your task is made more difficult due to the shape of the blocks
  (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game would it?).  Not all the blocks come in
  nice little squares, each level has its own unique set of blocks which require
  clever planning to successfully link them together into a platform for Mary.\n
  Further complicating things is that Mary appears to have started panicking and
  will run back and forth around the platform.  Remember that Mary is human
  (despite the gaping hole in her head!), and like most humans she doesn't take
  kindly to being squished with blocks (or having them swung into her).  Take
  special care when dropping blocks not to hit Mary or it's game over.  Also be
  sure to watch out for the low flying airplane that appears on the higher levels
  (yes I said Airplane).  If the plane hits your crane you will automatically drop
  the block you're carrying (possibly squishing Mary).\n
  Thankfully there are several power-ups to help you accomplish your task.
  Power-ups appear on the cliff sides and require that you pick them up and drop
  them off at the top of the canyon to activate them.  These power-ups do a wide
  variety of things:
  .
  The Plug - Stops the water from rising for a few seconds\n
  Stop Sign - Makes Mary stop hopping around like an idiot (very handy)\n
  Oil Can - Makes your crane move faster\n
  Gold Block - Makes Mary invincible to being squished by falling blocks\n
  Number - Gives you bonus points\n
  Mary Figure - Gives you extra life
  .
  Save Mary! tends to get tough fast if you don't learn how to make the most of
  the power-ups, and can quickly get out of control if you don't have a plan for
  how to stack the blocks.  Strategy and planning are the keys to winning Save
  Mary!, but taking too long will result in one waterlogged corpse.  Overall Save
  Mary! is a Tetris variant with enough variety to keep gamers coming back for
  more.  Atari had a winner on its hands, as Save Mary! was a game that could have
  made Atari owners say Wow!  Unfortunately the age of the 2600 was over and
  brilliant efforts like this ultimately came too late to save the dying system.
  On an interesting side note Nolan Bushnell himself is quoted as saying that Save
  Mary! was one of his favorite upcoming Atari 2600 releases.  One would think
  that with this kind of endorsement Save Mary! would have seen the light of day.

  Your divers are out in the ocean collecting treasure; now that they have found
  what they're looking for, you need to pilot a submarine and return them safely
  to the surface! You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely
  return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level.
  Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you
  will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less
  than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at
  all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous
  giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy
  your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited
  supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As
  the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.

description:
  It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done,
  the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by
  setting their self destructs.
  .
  You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an
  enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you
  energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one
  bottle per minute while exploring.
  .
  Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic
  blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter
  in later stations.
  .
  Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the
  teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight
  stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self
  destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be
  able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen.
  Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

description:
  Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of
  an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the
  Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats
  above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by
  using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an
  enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy
  it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at
  the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from
  time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the
  bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.

game: Shooting Arcade
file: ./Shooting Arcade (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Lightgun Shooter
description:
  Shooting Arcade is one of only two 2600 games to use the light gun (Sentinel was
  the other), but was never released.  This is a shame because Shooting Arcade is
  a creative light gun target game similar to the Point Blank series, and would
  have been unique among 2600 games.  Interestingly it appears that Shooting
  Arcade was not developed in the US, but rather in Mexico by a company called
  Heuristica.  How Axlon was invovled is unknown, but they may have simply
  sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves.\n
  Shooting Arcade is really made up of six different scenes that are put together
  in different orders depending on the level you've selected.  Each scene has its
  own unique theme, rules, and objective, making Shooting Arcade essentially six
  games in one.  Depending on which skill level you choose, the scene's attributes
  change to make it more or less difficult and the timer at the bottom of the
  screen counts down more or less quickly.  The status bar at the top of the
  screen shows the number of shots you have left, your current difficulty level,
  and the number of targets left.  You start each level out with a limited amount
  of ammunition depending on the difficulty level (40, 10, 5, 2, or 1).  You can
  continue from the last screen you completed an infinite amount of times by
  simply pressing the reset button.  This is a handy feature as the game get very
  hard at the later levels...\n
  The six scenes are:\n
  Colored Squares - Here you must shoot out all the colored squares before the
  timer runs out.  Starting on level 1 if you shoot and empty area where a square
  would be, a new square appear and you'll have to shoot it again!  On level 4 the
  squares will all disappear after you take your first shot, and you must memorize
  where all the squares were before you start.  The squares can briefly be seen
  when you take a shot which helps a bit, but they will reappear if you shoot the
  same area twice (as in level 1).  Every square you successfully hit will give
  you two extra shots.\n
  Shooting Gallery - This scene is reminiscent of Imagic's Shooting Gallery
  cartridge.  Here you must shoot various carnival targets such as glass pipes,
  ducks, milk jugs, colored squares, and dinosaurs?  The targets in the center
  area move at a fair clip (depending on the difficulty level) and the pipes at
  the top can be very difficult to hit making this scene one of the toughest in
  the game.  Speaking of squares, you can shoot the colored squares at the bottom
  of the screen to gain extra ammo if you're in need.  To clear this scene you
  must successfully shoot all the targets.\n
  The Birds - This scene is only accessible from level 2 onward.  In this scene
  you must shoot all the black and white birds before the timer runs out.  The
  birds move with a up and down motion, but follow a specific path around the
  screen so you can predict where they will move.  The background will change from
  black to white during the course of the scene effectively camouflaging the birds
  making them even more difficult to hit.\n
  Target Practice - This scene is one of the hardest to complete, since you begin
  with almost no ammo and the timer counts down lightning fast.  The concept of
  this scene is quite simple, you must shoot the various birds which fly around
  the screen.  Unlike the previous scene, these birds only appear one at a time
  and they move very very fast.  The birds will wrap around from one side of the
  screen to the other, so you can try and anticipate where it will appear next.
  This scene is only accessible from level 3 onward.\n
  The Demon - This scene is damn tough!  You must shoot a demon who randomly
  teleports around the screen.  Since this scene is only accessible on skill level
  4 you start low on ammo and have almost no time.  If you shoot the demon enough
  times you will move onto the final scene.\n
  The Unicycle - This is the final scene in the game.  Here you must shoot the
  unicycle out from underneath a poor clown and watch him fall to his death (ok so
  I made the last part up).  Since the unicycle is very thin and moves at a
  surprisingly fast clip, this scene is nearly impossible to beat.  Like the demon
  scene, this scene is only accessible on level 4.\n
  So why wasn't shooting arcade released?  No one knows the true reason, but one
  possibility is the horrid controls.  The light gun aim is so off it makes it
  almost impossible to hit something by aiming directly at it.  If your lucky
  enough to actually hit something, it's almost a guarantee that you'll never be
  able to hit it again as the shooting code is so buggy that shooting at the same
  spot three times in a row will result in hitting three completely different
  areas of the screen.  This problem is really the death nail for Shooting Arcade,
  and ruins what could have otherwise been an awesome game. If you can get over
  the flawed targeting system, Shooting Arcade can be really fun.  It's
  interesting to see just how much programmers could squeeze out of the ancient
  2600.

genre: Simulation
description:
  You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station.
  Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you
  will need to avoid.
  .
  After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At
  the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars.
  These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of
  the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the
  orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.
  .
  When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher
  than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something
  to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display.
  Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit
  something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel.
  This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have
  a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.
  .
  Game variations\n
  The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on
  the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0
  to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.
  .
  There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you
  got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.

  An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.
  .
  The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at
  drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released.
  Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft
  with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and
  is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is
  crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without
  releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering
  crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the
  Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's
  ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough
  crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all
  destroyed.

description:
  When you turn on Ski Run you're bombarded by an obnoxious jumble of noise.  Not
  the best first impression!  Your goal is to ski down a rigidly-defined mountain
  course lined with orange trees, rocks, and snow men.  Your skier is colorfully
  rendered and even uses his poles to turn from side-to-side.  I also like how the
  mountains in the distance slowly rise and fall.  You can adjust your speed as
  you glide down the vertically-scrolling screen while avoiding trees, rocks,
  frolicing deer, bobcats, and dancing bears.  Your score is constantly racking up
  depending on your velocity.  Adding challenge are jumps you need to perform over
  extended sections of gray muck.  You'll know a jump is about to happen when you
  reach a large batch of yellow snow.  I have to admit it feels satisfying when
  you nail a jump.  But much like Ski Hunt (Home Vision, 1983), Ski Run relies too
  much on luck.  There's virtually no time to react to oncoming obstacles, even
  when you try to control your speed.  Heck, just trying to stay within the
  confines of the course is a challenge.  You get 25 (!) lives but you'll be
  surprised how fast you blow through them.  Audio quality notwithstanding, Ski
  Run's pleasant visuals and non-stop action might be worth a try if you're
  looking for some winter-related fun.

  In Skiing, your goal is to ski to the bottom of the mountain in the shortest
  time possible. The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in
  the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a
  series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to
  your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as
  possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length
  of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)

  Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid
  skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the
  best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three
  second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at
  the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your
  plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as
  your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon
  count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane
  was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle
  down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need
  to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.

  the bottom of the stairs and flood the cavern further.
  .
  If Mickey fails to provide enough buckets, or stop the brooms, they will flood
  the cavern, and the game is over.

description:
  Space War für den Atari 2600 gehörte zu den ersten Heimadaptionen des
  klassischen Arcade-Spiels Spacewar!.
  .
  Die Cartridge enthält zwei verschiedene Spielmodi: Space War und Space Shuttle.
  Space War ist das klassische Eins-gegen-Eins-Spiel, in dem sich Raumschiffe
  duellieren, und erfordert zwei Spieler. Das Ziel ist es, den Gegner mit Raketen
  für einen Punkt pro Kill abzuschießen. Das Schiff jedes Spielers trägt acht
  Raketen und eine begrenzte Menge Treibstoff für seine Triebwerke. Ist die
  Munition aufgebraucht, wird automatisch nachgefüllt, allerdings nur, wenn der
  andere Spieler auch keine Schüsse mehr hat. Die Steuerung folgt dem
  Spacewar!/Asteroids-Modell der Impulserhaltung: Einmal beschleunigt, fliegt das
  Schiff weiter in die gleiche Richtung, bis seine Triebwerke erneut zünden. Es
  stehen sieben verschiedene Varianten von Space War zur Verfügung, die jeweils
  unterschiedliche Optionen umschalten: Die Bildschirmbegrenzung ist entweder fest
  und Schiffe und Schüsse prallen ab, oder sie kann durchquert werden und die
  Schiffe und Raketen erscheinen auf der anderen Seite des Bildschirms wieder.
  Wenn der Hyperraum verfügbar ist, kann ein Spieler vorübergehend unsichtbar
  werden, was jedoch viel Treibstoff verbraucht und die Waffen deaktiviert.
  Befindet sich eine Sonne in der Mitte des Spielfelds, zieht ihre Schwerkraft die
  Schiffe zu ihr hin und ein Zusammenstoß bringt dem Gegner einen Punkt ein. Wenn
  eine Sternenbasis vorhanden ist, können Schiffe an ihr vorbeifliegen, um
  Treibstoff und Munition nachzufüllen.

description:
  You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.
  .
  You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from
  the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.
  .
  Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands
  and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field
  has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field
  and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught
  within the field.
  .
  If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender,
  you lose a life.
  .
  The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.
  .
  The scoring is as follows:\n
  Destroy a fireball = 25 Points\n
  Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points\n
  Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points\n
  Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points\n
  Destroy a homer = 400 Points
  .
  You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.
  .
  When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next
  four, 2,000 points per base and so on.
  .
  You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000
  points.

  Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain!
  Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you
  approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a
  life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached
  so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen
  is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the
  deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can
  hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves
  are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing
  to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here
  you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly
  appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the
  mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or
  getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the
  mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before
  freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four

  A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from
  an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you
  get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any
  civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you
  drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon
  (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road
  splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat
  temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for
  icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you,
  including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or
  dropping bombs from a helicopter.

description:
  In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to
  blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen.
  Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to
  the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly
  growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation
  is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal
  is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A
  row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will
  then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks!
  When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next
  level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second
  one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still
  to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you.
  Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as
  many blocks as the easier.

  You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric
  creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes
  that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress
  bricks.
  .
  The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the
  opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it
  when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and
  always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks
  themselves, only in between them.
  .

  two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one
  life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the
  right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you
  must press reset to play again.
  .
  Scoring\n

description:
  As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the
  Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three
  different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters,
  and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of
  the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them.
  When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new
  location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy;
  warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid
  will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will
  be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time.
  Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can
  receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon
  torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have
  been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted
  if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually
  increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.

  Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by
  one or two players.
  .
  Star Ship\n
  These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star
  ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various
  enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the
  one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32
  seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and
  the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire.
  The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.
  .
  Warp Drive\n
  These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your
  goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming
  asteroids.
  .
  Lunar Lander\n
  These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to
  pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One
  point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may
  get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions,
  one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.
  .
  Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and
  level of difficulty.

  Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you
  take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation
  from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle
  your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round
  you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields,
  and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises
  energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight
  these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers
  and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more
  starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and
  torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the
  top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the
  ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view

  photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once
  a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next
  level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to
  the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which
  shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help

  Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Ewok Adventure, also known as Revenge of the
  Jedi: Game I, is a cancelled 1983 shoot 'em up video game based on the 1983 Star
  Wars film Return of the Jedi. The game was developed by Atari Games and was to
  be published by Parker Brothers on the Atari 2600. Although it was completed,
  the game was never released for sale, as the marketing department of Parker
  Brothers considered the controls too difficult to master.\n
  In Ewok Adventure, the player takes the role of an Ewok in the hang glider corps
  with the mission to destroy a shield generator of the Imperial army. The player
  can control a hang glider with the joystick and has to evade enemies, which
  include animations of speeder bikes, AT-AT walkers, Imperial stormtrooper-like
  figures and Ewoks. Other obstacles along the edges of the game include
  shrubbery, small boulders and small rivers.\n
  Depending on the game mode, the player can either make the hang glider climb and
  descend by pulling back and forth the joystick, or he can reverse the vertical
  directions. Hitting the ground results in a game over, but when flying high, one
  can fly over enemies. The height of the glider is displayed by the location of
  the shadow of the ship. Furthermore, the player can pick up rocks to drop on
  enemies when flying over them.

  right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the
  right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump,
  as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The
  better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has
  gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.
  .
  There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the
  hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being
  poor, good and excellent, respectively.\n
  In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the
  computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent,
  respectively.\n
  The difficulty switches are not used.

developer: Atari
publisher: Sears
genre: Strategie
description:
  This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college
  mainframes.
  .
  Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the
  joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the
  red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the
  parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or
  Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates.
  .
  The commands and any settings are as follows:
  .
  Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan.
  Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the
  number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero,
  depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map
  costs you no energy or stardates.
  .
  LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the
  quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do
  an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but
  it does take a turn.
  .
  SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your
  quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR
  Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR
  Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does
  take a turn.
  .
  Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to
  sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your
  direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:\n
  8  1  2\n
  | /\n
  7--*--3\n
  / |\n
  6  5  4\n
  Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move
  within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that
  quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant
  that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a
  quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you
  warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot
  warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go
  anywhere.
  .
  Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them.
  You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear
  line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes
  and they can be replenished.  Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just
  a turn.
  .
  Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the
  enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast
  to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to
  the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you
  fired. You also use a turn.
  .
  Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy
  units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to
  what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the
  damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your
  own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you
  must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You
  won't go anywhere but you will repair.
  .
  If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled
  and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and
  never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to
  the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.
  .
  Skill (Difficulty) switches\n
  The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A)
  position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B)
  position.\n
  The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your
  phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your
  phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.

  been positively identified:
  .
  Shifty\n
  2. Scar Face\n
  3. Mugsy\n
  4. Lefty\n
  5. Nitro Ed

  Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out
  for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're
  pushing up daisies. Good luck.
  .
  You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your
  ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof,
  will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each
  gangster shot. The values for level one are:
  .
  1. Mugsy=$20\n
  2. Scare Face=$30\n
  3. Lefty=$40\n
  4. Shifty=$50\n
  5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100
  .
  These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet
  you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a
  nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the
  windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.\n
  If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have
  less than $1000.
  .
  If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he
  will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose
  all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed
  gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over.
  And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another
  at $5000.

  You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you
  approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but
  apparently the automatic defense system still works.
  .
  You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in
  sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they
  are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot
  shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however.
  After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen.
  Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the
  patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.
  .
  You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot
  the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once
  there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to
  destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game

game: Stunt Cycle
file: ./Stunt Cycle (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Rennen, Fahren
description:
  Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first "Non-Pong" standalone consoles, and was
  based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of
  handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower
  and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making
  your "Stunt Cycle" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the
  other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the
  top of the screen, where you are given two "rows" of screen space to build up
  speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The "trick" to the game is to
  build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go
  crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row
  of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.\n
  It is interesting to note that the arcade version has your cycle move through
  'tubes' on the sides of the screen between rows whereas the home console version
  does not.  This means that in the arcade your cycle moves left to right across
  the first row, then RIGHT to LEFT across the second row before moving left to
  right again on the bottom.  This is a bit more realistic (well as realistic as
  motorcycle blasting through invisible tubes on the sides of the screen can be
  anyway) but can mess with your head if you're not expecting it.  The home
  console and 2600 port simply has the player 'warp' back to the left side of the
  screen when he reaches the end, meaning you always travel left to right on each
  row.\n
  Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so
  Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to
  simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a near perfect port of the
  standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of
  color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics
  were in Black and White which was standard at the time.  However Atari 2600
  games had to have the option of color or B&W, some color was added to the game
  (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt
  Cycle was finished and ready to go.\n
  It was around this time that marketing had "brilliant" idea; why not make Stunt
  Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the
  graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the
  General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  The colors were
  brightened up a little and some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to
  the game to complete the illusion. So after a few more months of tinkering, the
  new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go.  However by this
  point (late 1980/early 1981) the game was starting to look a bit dated so
  management decided that a completely new version would be better.  So programmer
  Mark Hahn of the Atari NY field office was tapped to do a new Dukes of Hazzard
  game from scratch which was also never released.\n
  So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of
  Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon
  realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you
  could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made
  the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of
  the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved,
  programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game
  from scratch (which was never released either).\n
  Stunt Cycle/Dukes of Hazzard has a few interesting options to keep the game
  fresh.  The first three variations allow the player to not worry about skidding
  out and change their speed mid-air during jumps, this is basically the 'easy'
  version of the game.  The second three variations are the 'pro' mode where
  players must watch their speed on turns (the invisible tubes on the edges of the
  screen) or they will skid out and crash, you also cannot change your speed
  during jumps in these variations.  The final three variations are a combination
  of the two modes in which you can still skid out, but you can also change your
  speed in mid-air.  The difficulty switches also control how large the landing
  zone will be.\n
  Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard
  question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had
  Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably
  would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what
  they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard
  for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people
  would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that
  the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the
  right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but
  screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up
  to another act of Atari mismanagement.\n
  Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never
  assigned a product number.

description:
  Super Breakout bietet ein ähnliches Gameplay wie das Original, aber mit mehreren
  neuen Spielvarianten. Ihr Ziel ist es, so viele Punkte wie möglich zu verdienen,
  indem Sie die Steine oben auf dem Spielfeld zerstören. Dazu müssen Sie das
  Paddel am unteren Rand des Bildschirms verwenden, um einen springenden Ball
  innerhalb des Spielfelds zu halten. Es sind vier verschiedene Spielvarianten
  enthalten. Das erste ist „Breakout“ und spielt sich genauso wie das
  Originalspiel.
  .
  Damit bleiben drei neue Gameplay-Konzepte übrig. In „Progressiv“ sinken die
  Mauern langsam zum unteren Rand des Bildschirms und der Ball bewegt sich immer
  schneller und schneller. Wenn Platz ist, erscheint oben eine neue Ziegelschicht.
  .
  Die anderen beiden Spiele fügen ein zweites Paddel hinzu. Bei „Double Breakout“
  haben Sie zwei Bälle, mit denen Sie im Spiel bleiben und punkten können. In
  „Cavity“ ist zu Beginn ein einzelner Ball im Spiel, aber zwei zusätzliche Bälle
  sind in den Steinen eingeschlossen. Diese werden befreit, wenn die sie
  umgebenden Steine zerstört werden.

  You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You
  must avoid the wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering
  treasure. Then you must escape from the dungeons.
  .
  You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are
  rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat,
  gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each
  room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have
  either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece,
  it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.
  .
  In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next
  two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later
  levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you
  will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points
  and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the
  screen and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms
  have only unlocked doors but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can
  search the doors for the exit.
  .
  The items in the maze, and their uses, are:
  .
  1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level\n
  2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of
  each other item\n
  3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or
  two.\n
  4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than
  twenty-five total life points.\n
  5. Cross:  Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can\n
  6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a
  visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.\n
  7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters\n
  8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last
  dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get
  the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new
  keys.

  Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve
  beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane
  lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the
  end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one
  and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them
  throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.
  .
  Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab
  it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers
  occupied.
  .
  The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus
  multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.

genre: Action
description:
  You are John Q and you want to be rich.
  .
  In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the
  money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red
  snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a
  day goes by. My, how time flies.
  .
  Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must
  collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio
  (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on
  this screen is a character whose color changes.
  .
  What color he is determines who he is:\n
  Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these
  audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back
  to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.\n
  Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you
  $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a
  better one.\n
  Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put
  you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most
  profit.
  .
  After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter.
  The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.

game: Telepathy
file: ./Telepathy (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's
  failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his
  head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's
  sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would
  make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it
  did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial
  test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and
  dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results,
  the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled.\n
  Telepathy was actually developed as a demo to show what kind games the Mindlink
  could do.  This "demo" is made up of seven different action screens held
  together by a loose "mine" theme.  Thankfully Telepathy is playable without the
  Mindlink controller (unlike Bionic Breakthrough) by pressing the joystick
  button.  It's unknown if Atari was thinking of releasing Telepathy sans Mindlink
  or if the joystick code was put in the game for playtesting purposes.\n
  Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through
  all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control
  the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional
  or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from
  the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked
  off to the first screen.\n
  -The Plain-\n
  This is the oddest screen in the whole game, because it doesn't seem to fit the
  theme of the rest of the screens.  You control a large white man with antennas
  sticking out of his head.  You must guide the man over the glowing triangles as
  he walks along the plain.  The glowing triangles appear in a weaving line (like
  a trail of bread crumbs) and will eventually lead to a large hole in the ground.
  Each glowing triangle is initially worth 5 points, but each successive triangle
  you collect is worth an addition 5 points (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.).  If you miss a
  triangle the point value starts back over at 5.  The controls on this level are
  a bit strange, as the man will always want to move to the far left side of the
  screen.  You must struggle to keep him moving on the proper path, collecting
  triangles as he goes.  As you get to the higher mines the amount of triangles
  and the speed at which you walk increase.  The pattern of the triangles will
  also become more twisted and harder to follow.  Once you reach the hole at the
  end of the path you are taken to the spider screen.\n
  -Spiders-\n
  This is the first level in the mine itself.  Your guy is now a small Indiana
  Jones looking character instead of the large man with the antennas.  Your
  character looks so much like Indiana Jones in fact that some people initially
  speculated that this prototype was really Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
  (this was before the names on the EPROM's were known).  The goal of this level
  is to run past the spiders and get to the hole at the bottom of the screen
  before the timer runs out.  If you get hit by one of the spiders, you start over
  at the top of the screen and lose a life.  The spiders are fast and hard to
  avoid because they bounce around the screen, but you can always find a safe zone
  at the edges of each ledge.  You can either run (your normal mode of
  transportation) or walk by holding down the fire button.  Walking allows you to
  move more accurately, but since it's speed that counts you'll want to run to the
  exit.  You have 15 seconds to complete this level, but since the timer counts in
  tenths of a second it starts at 1500.  From here on every time you complete a
  level you'll get 100 points for each second left on timer.  In the higher mines
  the spiders are faster and move more erratically.\n
  -Elevators-\n
  This level starts to appear beginning in mine 2.  The board structure is very
  similar to the spider level, but instead of avoiding spiders you need to avoid
  moving elevator platforms.  If your man happens to bump into a moving platform
  he'll be thrown back a bit, but if he steps onto one he'll be transported back
  to the top of the elevator.  Since time is short anything that keeps you from
  getting to the screen is bad, even if it's not deadly.  For some reason the
  holes in the ledges have been replaced by white hatches, but they function the
  same way.  In later mines the speed of the elevators increases dramatically.\n
  -Ledges-\n
  This level begins to appear starting in mine 3.  You must carefully maneuver you
  man as he falls from ledge to ledge, avoiding the fireballs being shot from the
  sides of the mine.  The fireballs move with blinding speed, and with your slow
  rate of decent there is almost time to avoid them.  You can tell where the
  fireballs are about come from by looking for the red glow around the rocks on
  the sides of the screen.  The best strategy for this level is to land on each
  ledge and wait for the next fireball to launch before continuing.  In later
  mines the ledges begin to move making things even more difficult.\n
  -The Mashers-\n
  This level starts to appear from mine 4 onward.  At first glance the level
  appears to be empty, but suddenly large mashers will quickly descend and retract
  from the ceiling.  Timing is crucial on this level as the mashers are very fast
  and are invisible until they descend from the ceiling.  As always, your goal is
  to reach the bottom of the screen before the timer runs out.\n
  -The Miner-\n
  This level is rather simple.  After your man falls down the shaft you can either
  walk over to the left and save the stranded miner (ala HERO), or exit to the
  right and forget the miner.  Grabbing the miner doesn't seem to do anything, but
  since this is the goal of the game it would be dumb not to.  If you choose to
  rescue the miner you can levitate out of the hole by pushing against the wall.
  There are large boulders which fall down from the top of the shaft, but they're
  slow so they don't pose much of a threat (although the speed does increase with
  each mine).\n
  -The River-\n
  This is always the last level in each mine.  On this level you must move your
  man through the gaps in the river walls while avoiding the deadly piranha.  The
  controls are similar to the Plain level as you man will constantly move to the
  left unless you keep pushing the joystick to the right.  Your man will
  automatically move through the gaps in the river when he is in front of them,
  but since the level is constantly scrolling forward this is a good thing.  If
  you get bumped off the bottom of the screen or touch a piranha your man will be
  killed and you'll have to start the level over.  The higher the mine level, the
  faster the fish and scrolling become.  If you complete this level you will be
  transported to the next mine.\n
  It's unknown if Atari actually ever planned to turn Telepathy into a commercial
  game, but as it stands it's one hell of a demo.  It's hard to believe that these
  mini-games would work well with the hard to use Mindlink controller, as they
  require pin point precision, constant movement, and other things that the
  Mindlink didn't do well.  They do however work quite well with the joystick,
  which may be why that code was added.  So fire up the emulator and enjoy
  Telepathy, the best game that never was.

description:
  Until now, I've never encountered a bad version of Tetris. Obviously, some ports
  are better than others, but the game is kind of like Pong; as long as you get
  the basic mechanics right, you're golden. Tetris 26, however, feels unfinished ?
  almost like a homebrew prototype. With all apologies to programmer Colin Hughes
  (this is apparently his only homebrew to date), Tetris 26 is just not very good.
  It lacks the smoothness of the best versions of the game; adjusting the puzzle
  piece to fit is particularly jarring as your piece flashes as it rotates. The
  colours of a Tetris game should be bright and vibrant but this version is dull
  and washed out. And sound? Unless there's something wrong with my copy, there
  literally is no sound.

  Der Activision Decathlon ist eine Serie von olympischen Spielen, die der

  Disziplinen eines realen Zehnkampfs antreten, entweder nacheinander oder
  einzeln. Enthalten sind der 100-Meter-Lauf, Weitsprung, Kugelstoßen, Hochsprung,
  400-Meter-Lauf, 110-Meter-Hürdenlauf, Diskuswurf, Stabhochsprung, Speerwurf und
  1500-Meter-Lauf.
  .
  Die flachen Laufwettbewerbe erfordern einfaches Joystick-Wackeln, das mit genau
  getimten Tastendrücken ausgeglichen werden muss, um die Hürden zu überwinden -
  ein Aufprall oder eine Unterbrechung des Schritts führt zu einem Verlust von
  Schwung und damit von Zeit. Bei den Sprung- und Wurfdisziplinen musst du durch
  Wackeln des Joysticks Schwung aufbauen und dann den Knopf drücken, um im
  richtigen Moment zu werfen oder zu springen.
  .
  Für jede Disziplin gibt es Punkte, je nachdem, wie gut du abschneidest (dies
  kann auf deiner Laufzeit basieren oder darauf, wie weit du den Speer oder den
  Diskus wirfst, usw...), und der Spieler mit den meisten Punkten am Ende des
  Zehnkampfs gewinnt die Goldmedaille.

  If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack

  found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the
  differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the
  gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.
  .
  It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume
  it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and
  didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was
  ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team
  characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting
  at best, confusing to say the least.

  Threshold is a simple Shoot'em up game. You are in control of a spaceship at the
  bottom of the screen and have to shoot several formations of enemies on the top
  of the screen.\n
  To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which
  will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that your
  spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot make the
  heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire
  anymore and are forced to wait until it cooled down while slowly running out of
  fuel.

  There are six Core nuclear bases on the planet's surface. You must burrow
  underground to each of these bases and destroy them. But be warned, they are
  guarded by patrolling Core Ranger tanks that if they get you in their line of

  .
  There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing
  tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them.
  The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also
  a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve
  tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you
  lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.
  .
  There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get
  you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have
  no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the
  start.

game: Thwocker
file: ./Thwocker (USA) (Proto).a26
publisher: Activision
genre: Action
description:
  Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor
  fame), Thwocker was described as "Joust with musical instruments".  While this
  isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements
  that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor
  (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze
  collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various
  musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).
  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in
  the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the
  screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your
  conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After
  collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the
  maze to start the song.  Once the song starts to play your character will be
  able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until
  the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the
  exit square.\n
  The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky
  as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy
  material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how
  high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor
  take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him
  bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire
  button, which will make the conductor sort of "skip" across the level.  You will
  need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the
  level.\n
  Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was
  thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing
  the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It
  appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the
  song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.
  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more
  to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow "combine"
  the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.
  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but
  it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.
  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's
  actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable
  after all.\n
  Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty
  levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other
  known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when
  development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for
  us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully
  playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues
  left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select
  screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in
  between 9 and 10.  These game numbers are represented by a space, another space,
  a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most
  likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16
  games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be
  16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the
  conclusion that they were indeed planned.\n
  Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market
  in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out
  of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.
  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but
  Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on
  converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished
  games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were
  much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).
  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all
  enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.

  Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need
  to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you
  have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota,
  a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the
  next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed
  you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes,
  but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it
  tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even
  flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run
  into this, you will earn bonus points.

  boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

  Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM
  7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

  coats applied in the proper order! And not that you needed the additional

  wurde, können seine 12 KB Speicher das Labyrinth in drei Dimensionen darstellen.
  Daher ist das Spielfeld ein farbenfrohes, dreidimensionales Labyrinth, sodass
  Sie sich nie selbst sehen ... nur die Wände auf beiden Seiten von Ihnen, die die
  Korridore bilden, durch die Sie reisen. Wenn Sie sich durch die Gänge bewegen,
  erscheinen auf beiden Seiten zusätzliche Tunnel, in die Sie einbiegen können,
  indem Sie nach links und rechts drücken.
  .
  Ihr Hauptziel ist es, den versteckten Schlüssel zu finden und einzusammeln, der
  sich an einer anderen Stelle in jedem Labyrinth befindet. Mithilfe eines MAP
  können Sie sich im Labyrinth bewegen. Während Sie versuchen, den Schlüssel zum
  Verlassen des Levels zu finden, müssen Sie auch den hungrigen Zots ausweichen.
  Sie werden diese feindlichen Kreaturen im gesamten Labyrinth entdecken. Das
  erfolgreiche Wiedererlangen des Schlüssels, ohne von den Zots abgefangen zu
  werden, öffnet das Portal zum nächsten Level. Wenn Sie jedes Level bestehen,
  werden Sie feststellen, dass die Komplexität und Schwierigkeit zunimmt, während
  Ihre KARTE nach und nach immer weniger Informationen preisgibt … letztendlich
  wird Ihre Karte von geringem Nutzen sein und Sie müssen nur durch Instinkte und
  schnelles Denken überleben!

game: Turmoil
file: ./Turmoil (USA).a26
developer: Sirius
publisher: Fox Video Games
genre: Action
description:
  Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a
  chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical
  corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of
  enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the
  ultimate objective of "Turmoil" is to zoom up and down the center alley and
  blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will
  survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also
  fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of
  this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.
  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move
  onward once more.
  .
  The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a
  variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you
  will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy
  ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one
  exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these
  situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab
  it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast
  moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
  .
  When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast
  all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your
  current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will
  loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine
  levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster
  and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be
  one of 20th Century Fox's best games.

file: ./Unknown 20th Century Fox Game (USA) (Proto).a26
description:
  Believe me when I say that this prototype is a complete mystery.  No programmer,
  no model number, and only a guess on the company  We don't even know the name of
  the game.  The only we have as to the identity of this prototype is the name
  Universal, which is silk screened onto the EPROM board.  We now speculate that
  this might have been a TCF game as another Universal style board was recently
  found in a TCF prototype.  If this is indeed a TCF game then it might be the
  mysterious Six Pack that was mentioned in early manuals (based on the racing
  movie of the same name), however the drag racing aspect fits closer to the TCF
  movie Heart Like A Wheel (pat yourself on the back if you actually remember that
  movie).  The only flaw with this theory is that no game was ever announced for
  that movie.\n
  While we may never know the true identity of this game, it's a sure fire bet
  that it was meant to be a clone of Activision's Dragster (which is really a
  clone of Atari's Drag Race).  However unlike Dragster or Drag Race which are
  viewed from the side, this game is viewed from behind.  The perspective is
  similar to that of Activision's Enduro, right down to the vanishing point on the
  horizon.   It's immediately obvious from the graphics that a lot of work was
  being put into this game.\n
  As previously mentioned, this game is really just a clone of Dragster.  The
  player must rev his engine and change gears as fast as possible without blowing
  the engine.  However unlike Dragster the player actually has control over his
  car and can steer it around the lane.  The faster the player goes, the further
  the car will move into the horizon and the harder it is to keep from crashing
  into the sides of the lane.  Careful steering is a must if you're going to win a
  race in this game.\n
  The controls in this prototype are a bit screwy, and can easily frustrate
  someone who isn't familiar with them.  Starting the race is particularly
  annoying, as the player must press left, up, and right until the little man
  drops the white flag (or the light turns green).  Once the race has started,
  pressing up will cause the car to accelerate, while pressing down will change
  gears.  When pressing down the gear indicator will briefly change from N
  (Neutral) to C indicating that you are changing gears, continuing to press down
  will cause the car to shift into gears 1 through 4.\n
  As you increase your speed the meter at the bottom of the screen will show your
  current engine temperature.  If you go too fast in a low gear, your engine will
  blow.  By shifting gears at the proper time you will enable your car to move
  faster without blowing the engine.  Once you've reached the finish line, you
  must press the fire button to launch your parachute and slow your car down.  If
  you do not launch your parachute in time your car will crash.  Pressing the
  select button will enable the computer driver which takes over the first players
  spot (the car will turn yellow).  To race against the computer you will have to
  use the second players joystick.  There are three different computer components
  to race against, a yellow car, blue car, and finally a red car.  You will have
  to race the blue and yellow cars a few times in order to see the red car.\n
  There are two different racing variations available in this prototype, which can
  be selected by toggling the left difficulty switch. When the switch is in the A
  position the race takes place on a city street (which looks suspiciously like
  Sega's Turbo) with stock cars and a man with a white flag that starts the race.
  When the switch is in the B position the race takes place out in the desert with
  dragsters and the race is started by an automatic light.  This is little
  difference between the two except the dragster variation moves faster than the
  stock car variation (the player must switch gears faster).  While it may appear
  that there is no one player option for the dragster variation, there actually is
  but you really have to work to get to it.  In order to get to the one player
  dragster race you must first beat all three opponents (yellow, blue, and red),
  and then you will start the next race in the desert.\n
  While it isn't the best game out there, this racing game show promise and it's
  mysterious nature simply adds to allure.  This prototype was auctioned off by
  Best Electronics in 2004, and released by Curt Vendel of the Atari History
  Museum on Atari Age for the classic gaming community to enjoy.

description:
  Found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko, the identity of this
  mysterious Activision prototype has eluded collectors for years. This prototype
  plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding tile puzzle game.
  The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to
  dark. If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen
  with the colors descending from red to purple. However lining up all the colors
  is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the
  board.\n
  When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that
  row will move behind your square's new position. For instance if your square is
  the light green one (center of the row), and you move it left it will result in
  the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it. If you move
  right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move
  behind your square. Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the
  puzzle. If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire
  button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black. While
  this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help
  you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.

description:
  This mysterious prototype was found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko.
  Since the label that once existed for this game has long since fallen off, we
  have no idea what the identity of this game might be.\n
  In this game you control a little alien who must use the blocks at the bottom of
  the screen to build a tower and escape. As the blocks come rolling down the
  conveyer belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the
  screen. Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump
  on the conveyer belt and then climb the tower to the next screen.\n
  The graphics and sounds for this game are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of
  work went into this game. Everything from the smooth animation of your character
  to the cute "Can-Can" sequence at the start of the game (yes, you read that
  right) screams quality. So why was this game never released? Unfortunately, no
  one but the programmer knows the answer to this. One possibility is that he or
  she may have left Activision before the game was completed.

  Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to

  heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is
  broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone,
  stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features
  different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either
  horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also
  come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship
  temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies
  which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped
  with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions,
  however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on
  your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will
  crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make
  sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the
  various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more
  difficult skill level.

  Venture II was created by Tim Snider as a sequel to the classic game Venture.
  Only 24 copies of Venture II were produced. The first four carts were part of a
  pre-production run so Tim could get the manufacturing process fine tuned. Those
  first four are marked with Greek letters on the label. Tim then created 20
  numbered copies of Venture II which he made available privately at the 2001
  Classic Gaming Expo. One copy of Venture II sold at the CGE2K1 auction and went
  for over $200. Tim created perhaps the most extravagant packaging seen for a
  self-published title at the time--the game was delivered in a hand-crafted,
  miniature treasure chest, which opened to reveal the cartridge (with numbered
  label) and a manual, surrounded by elegant, gold leaf paper.
  .
  If you'd like to purchase a copy of Venture II (sans the fancy treasure chest
  packaging), you can do so in the AtariAge Store. Included is a beautifully
  illustrated twelve page manual by Dale Crum.

  This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in
  this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved
  then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go
  and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning
  sound and not make the move.
  .
  To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your
  king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then
  automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot
  castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares
  between the king and rook are threatened.
  .
  Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy
  pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant,
  you must advance your\n
  pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving\n
  his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two\n
  squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows
  you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was
  skipped over.
  .
  Skill levels\n
  These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are
  approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.\n
  Level 1=15 seconds\n
  Level 2=30 seconds\n

  castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares
  between the king and rook are threatened.
  .
  Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy
  pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant,
  you must advance your\n
  pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving\n
  his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two\n
  squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows
  you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was
  skipped over.
  .
  Skill levels\n
  These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are
  approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.\n
  Level 1=15 seconds\n
  Level 2=30 seconds\n
  Level 3=45 seconds\n
  Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds\n
  Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds\n
  Level 6=12 minutes\n
  Level 7=10 hours\n
  Level 8=10 seconds
  .
  Level 8 is a beginner level.

genre: Action
description:
  Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game
  Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the
  screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the
  most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no
  obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles,
  and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around,
  but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the
  goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:
  .
  1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat
  like a foozball table.
  .
  2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and
  one player) and the goal is much narrower.
  .
  3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at
  the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.
  .
  4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left
  sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one
  person defending each of the four goals.
  .
  5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball
  against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent
  is unable to return the ball.
  .
  6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a "net" in
  the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce
  the ball past their opponent.
  .
  7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen,
  and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.

  Video Simon by Mark De Smet is certainly the best-looking version of the Simon
  electronic game for the 2600 (the others being the Off Your Rocker prototype and

  needs to write an instruction manual for this thing, and seeing as Simon is a
  pretty intuitive game (it was designed for kids after all) that's not a good
  sign.
  .
  First of all, I'm kind of lost as to how I'm supposed to push the joystick (or
  press the keyboard keys as it were) to select one of the four light buttons.
  This really shouldn't be a problem ? Simon has four light panels and the 2600
  joystick moves in eight directions; it's not rocket science. Oh and what a
  godawful noise this thing makes if you press the wrong light button ? just like
  the physical Simon except it just goes on and on and on. Sometimes the noise
  kicks in before you even have a chance to make your move.

  half a minute you have seen everything in the game. If the first screen is still
  empty, you will find in the second a standing policeman, who has to be skipped.
  In the third section, there are already two and so on. The boost is that the

  the faster elapse of the time pad.

description:
  Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.
  .
  The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn
  as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander
  about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may
  shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear
  temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be
  used to locate creatures that are invisible.
  .
  When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature
  moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys
  the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score
  dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the
  Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the
  maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.
  .
  The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.

game: Wizard
file: ./Wizard (USA) (Proto).a26
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  If there was ever an obscure prototype it's Wizard.  Wizard was supposedly the
  last of Atari's last 2K games, but went unreleased in favor of the new 4K games.
  Since Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never
  assigned a part number, most people don't even know of its existence.\n
  Wizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor.  You
  control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy
  the swirling star shaped creature.  The board layout is a giant maze, which
  makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off.
  Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it
  can't shoot through them.  Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard
  dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot.  Once your wizard
  is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot.
  You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot
  in the direction of the creature.  This makes it easy to run away but still take
  shots at the creature.\n
  Your wizard starts out with zero damage (indicated by the right number), and
  will die if the damage counter reaches 99.  Each shot you take from the creature
  causes you two points of damage, touching the creature will also cause you two
  points of damage.  As you take more and more damage your wizard will weaken
  until he finally dies.  In your weakened state you will move slower and take
  longer to recharge.\n
  The creatures damage counter is on the left side of the screen.  Each time you
  shoot the creature it will take two points so damage and be stunned for a few
  seconds.  This is your chance to get away to a safe distance and hide as you
  recharge.  The creature is normally invisible unless it's shooting at you or it
  has taken a hit.  You can tell where the creature is by listening to the
  "heartbeat" in the background.  The closer the creature, the louder the sound.\n
  If you manage to get the creature's damage counter up to 99, it will turn black
  and die.  Your victory is short lived however as a new and more deadly creature
  will replace the old one.  Each new creature starts with less damage than the
  previous one, and moves and shoots much faster.  Each time you kill the creature
  your kill counter (next to the creatures damage counter) will go up by one, and
  your damage counter will go down significantly.\n
  Wizard has a unique two player feature where one player can control the wizard
  while the other player controls the creature.  Since the creature is normally
  invisible, the second player must move blindly about the maze until he comes in
  range of the wizard.  The second player's creature will automatically fire at
  the player making his job slighty easier.  This interesting twist on the normal
  two player variation shows some innovation not seen in many games.\n
  Hidden in a random part of the maze is a small glowing flame.  If the left
  difficulty switch is set to A then you Wizard has the added task of defending
  the flame.  If the creature touches the flame your wizard will slow down as his
  source of power has been captured.  On the easy setting the flame is
  invulnerable to the creature and doesn't have any affect on the game.\n
  While Wizard may not look like much today, it's amazingly fun in short bursts.
  Unfortunately by the time Wizard was ready to be released (1980), Atari was
  starting to make 4K games with better sounds and graphics than their 2K
  predecessors.  According to programmer Chris Crawford "It didn't fit well into
  the product line".  Wizard was simply too dated to be released as is, but
  probably could have been made into a decent 4K game had Atari wanted to take the
  time to retool it.  But as they say, time waits for no man.  Sadly Wizard was
  left in dust, destined only to become a footnote in prototype history.

game: Word Zapper
file: ./Word Zapper (USA).a26
developer: U.S. Games
publisher: U.S. Games
genre: Action
description:
  The player controls a "Zapper" similar to a spaceship that can move on the
  screen and pull up, left and right. The goal is to draw the letters that spell
  out the current word in order, while avoiding the asteroids in the lower part of
  the screen. There are four types of asteroids and each has a different effect if
  it comes into contact with the Zapper. The asteroid "Doomsday" ends the game.
  The asteroid "Scroller" mixes scrolling letters for five seconds. Asteroids
  "Zonker" and "Bonker" hit the Zapper sideways.\n
  The game ends after being hit by an apocalyptic asteroid, after the end of the
  time limit of 99 seconds or the ultimate goal of ending three words.

description:
  We don't have a manual for game play mechanics but it appears to work as
  follows. When you first start you have a title screen with ABC song playing and
  it does play the whole song in its own off-tune quirky nature. You hit reset to
  begin. Your ship appears at the bottom along with the number of lives, the
  score, and a line for holding 12 letters. You're continually fired upon by three
  invaders on the top row. Rows between you contain letters and objects like fruit
  hearts and creatures. Your shots are steered up the screen by moving your ship
  left and right. Shooting a letter will make it appear in the space below your
  ship and is worth a point. You have space for 12 letters here adding each
  additional letter will remove one from the left hand side. Shooting any other
  object will cause you to lose a life, a point, and will remove the last letter
  added. Getting hit by the invaders does the same thing except you lose all your
  points and it restarts to zero. Hitting one of the invaders on the top row earns
  you a whopping 50 points. I did try completing several very basic words like
  DOG, CAT, BOY, and GIRL but they didn't seem to register. Once you complete your
  word you might then have to register it by hitting an object or one of the
  invaders at the top, but since there were no words in the ROM I do imagine this
  aspect was not completed.

  .
  You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but
  you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up
  or down on the joystick.
  .
  As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank.
  Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to
  refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by
  a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.
  .
  In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In
  co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels
  both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get
  enemies and fuel.

description:
  Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call
  is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single
  ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch
  into acid-spitting Xenos.
  .
  A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before
  it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble
  your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either
  clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick
  up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles,
  Poofer guns, and bombs.
  .
  Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.
  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.

game: Yahtzee

publisher: Hozer Video Games
genre: Brettspiele
description:
  Here is what the programmer, Russell Babylon, had to say: "At present this is a
  one player game. The game follows standard Yahtzee rules. The only exception is
  that you can only score extra Yahtzees as a Yahtzee (some versions of the rules
  allow you to score extra Yahtzees as combinations less than a Yahtzee). The game
  control is very intuitive. You use the left joystick to play the game. From the
  title screen press the fire button to go to the game screen and roll the dice.
  The five dice are white in color which indicates they are all unselected. Pull
  the joystick down or move it right or left to highlight a die. The highlighted
  die will flash. Press the fire button to select the die. Move the joystick in
  any direction to move away from the die. Notice that the selected die will now
  be green in color. Repeat the above sequence to select all the dice you wish to
  keep. Now move the joystick up or down so that no dice are flashing and you have
  not highlighted any scoring options. Press the fire button to roll the
  unselected dice. You may roll the dice a total of three times. After any roll
  you may score your dice combination by pulling down or up repeatedly on the
  joystick until you have highlighted the scoring option you wish to use. Press
  the fire button when the appropriate scoring option is highlighted and if your
  dice combination is correct you will get the appropriate score. There are no
  take backs so be careful with your scoring. I have been working on some AI
  algorithms to have the computer play a game of Yahtzee against you but these are
  in the early stages."

game: Yars' Revenge

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action-Shoot'em Up
description:
  In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located
  on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar,
  which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running
  into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to
  destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen,
  and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't
  completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is
  a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This
  missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a
  shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable
  to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The
  Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should
  be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next,
  faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the
  difficulty and speed of the game.

genre: Shoot'em Up
description:
  The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em
  up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages,
  first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft,
  guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to
  progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.
  .
  Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you
  failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the
  final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you
  can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls
  involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight
  simulation.

genre: Strategie-Puzzle
description:
  In this adaptation of the classic puzzler, gameplay is pretty much like any
  other clone of Tetris. All the familiar pieces we've come to know and love are
  all there, and the object is still to strategically place them such that
  complete rows are created so that the rows keep disappearing at the bottom. One
  deficiency found in all 2600 versions has to do with the inability to rotate the
  tiles in both directions. In Z-Blocks' case, the one fire button turns the tiles
  90 degrees clockwise. It's not a hindrance to playability, but experts who
  relied on the option of flipping pieces in both directions will point to this
  omission as a sore spot. In every other facet, however, Z-Blocks has it covered.
